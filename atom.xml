A tall, black-haired witch in <u>emerald</u>-green robes stood there. She had a very <u>stern</u> face and Harry’s first thought was that this was not someone to cross.</p><blockquote><ul><li>em‧e‧rald /ˈemərəld/ :  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] a bright green colour </li><li>stern /stɜːn $ stɜːrn/ :  <em>adjective</em>  serious and strict, and showing strong disapproval of someone’s behaviour<br>sterner penalties for drug offences<br>stern look/voice/expression etc<br> ‘Wait!’ I shouted in my sternest voice.<br>stern warning/rebuke<br> His actions have earned him stern rebukes from human rights organizations.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“The firs’ years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.</p><blockquote><p>麦格教授出现在大门前，高个子，黑色头发，穿着翠绿色的长袍，</p></blockquote><p>“Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them from here.”</p><p>She pulled the door wide. The entrance hall was so big you could have fit the whole of the Dursleys’ house in it. The stone walls were <u>lit</u> with <u>flaming</u> <u>torches</u> like the ones at Gringotts, the <u>ceiling</u> was too high to make out, and a magnificent <u>marble</u> <u>staircase</u> facing them led to the upper floors.</p><blockquote><p>霍格沃茨的门厅很大，大得能把德思礼的整个家装进去。像古灵阁一样，石墙周围是燃烧的火炬，天花板很高，迎面是巨大的大理石楼梯。</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>lit /lɪt/ :  a past tense and past participle of light </li><li>flam‧ing /ˈfleɪmɪŋ/ :  <em>adjective</em>  orange or bright red in colour<br>flaming red hair</li><li>torch /tɔːtʃ $ tɔːrtʃ/ :  <em>noun</em>  a long stick with burning material at one end that produces light<br>the Olympic torch</li><li>cei‧ling /ˈsiːlɪŋ/ :  <em>noun</em>  the inner surface of the top part of a room → roof<br>rooms with high ceilings<br> a light hanging from the ceiling</li><li>make out:  <em>phrasal verb</em>  SEE/HEAR make something ↔ out to be just able to see or hear something<br>He could just make out a dark shape moving towards him.<br>make out who/what etc<br> I couldn’t make out what he was saying.</li><li>mar‧ble /ˈmɑːbəl $ ˈmɑːr-/ :  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] a type of hard rock that becomes smooth when it is polished, and is used for making buildings, statues etc<br>The columns were of white marble.<br> a marble statue</li><li>stair‧case /ˈsteəkeɪs $ ˈster-/ :  <em>noun</em> a set of stairs inside a building with its supports and the side parts that you hold on to</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="进入学校后，新生先被带到一个小空房间里训话。"><a href="#进入学校后，新生先被带到一个小空房间里训话。" class="headerlink" title="进入学校后，新生先被带到一个小空房间里训话。"></a>进入学校后，新生先被带到一个小空房间里训话。</h3><p>They followed Professor McGonagall across the <u>flagged stone</u> floor. Harry could hear the <u>drone</u> of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty <u>chamber</u> off the hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering about nervously.</p><blockquote><ul><li>flag‧stone /ˈflæɡstəʊn $ -stoʊn/ :  <em>noun</em> a <u>smooth</u> flat piece of stone used for floors, paths etc <ul><li>smooth /smuːð/ :  <em>adjective</em>  (comparative smoother, superlative smoothest)   SURFACE a smooth surface has no rough parts, lumps, or holes, especially in a way that is pleasant and attractive to touch <strong>OPP:</strong> rough<br>Her skin felt smooth and cool.<br> a smooth pebble<br> The stone steps had been worn smooth.</li></ul></li><li>drone /drəʊn $ droʊn/ :  <em>verb</em>  [singular] a continuous low dull sound<br>drone of<br> the steady drone of traffic</li><li>cham‧ber /ˈtʃeɪmbə $ -ər/ :  <em>noun</em>  MEETING ROOM [countable] a large room in a public building used for important meetings<br>the council chamber</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Welcome to Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start-of-term <u>banquet</u> will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the <u>Great Hall</u>, you will be sorted into your Houses. The Sorting is a very important <u>ceremony</u> because, while you are here, your House will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your House, sleep in your House dormitory, and spend free time in your House common room.</p><blockquote><p> Great Hall 大礼堂</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>ban‧quet /ˈbæŋkwɪt/ :  <em>noun</em>  a formal dinner for many people on an important occasion<br>a state banquet (=one attended by heads of government and other important people)</li><li>cer‧e‧mo‧ny /ˈserəməni $ -moʊni/ :  <em>noun</em>  (plural ceremonies)   [countable] an important social or religious event, when a traditional set of actions is performed in a formal way → ceremonial<br>a wedding ceremony<br>the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games</li></ul></blockquote><p>“The four Houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each House has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are at Hogwarts, your <u>triumphs</u> will earn your House points, while any rulebreaking will lose House points. At the end of the year, the House with the most points is awarded the House cup, a great honor. I hope each of you will <u>be a credit to</u> whichever House becomes yours.</p><blockquote><p>四大学院，格兰芬多 Gryffindor、赫奇帕奇 Hufflepuff、拉文克劳 Ravenclaw和斯莱特林 Slytherin。根据学生表现，给学院加减分，年底分数最高的获得“学院杯” House cup</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>triumph /ˈtraɪəmf/ :  <em>verb</em> to gain a victory or success after a difficult struggle<br>triumph over<br>In the end, good shall triumph over evil.</li><li>be a credit to somebody/something:  (also do somebody/something credit) to behave so well or be so successful that your family, team etc are proud of you<br>She’s a credit to her profession.<br>Your children really do you credit.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes <u>in front of</u> the rest of the school.

Harry nervously tried to <u>flatten</u> his hair.</p><blockquote><p>麦格教授的目光在纳威的斗篷（系带在他的左耳下面）还有他的脏鼻子上游离了一下。</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>lin‧ger /ˈlɪŋɡə $ -ər/ :  <em>verb</em>  [always + adverb/preposition] to continue looking at or dealing with something for longer than is usual or desirable<br>linger on/over<br>Mike let his eyes linger on her face.<br>There’s no need to linger over this stage of the interview.</li><li>smudge /smʌdʒ/ :  <em>noun</em> a dirty mark <strong>SYN:</strong> smear<br>smudge of<br>a smudge of lipstick on the cup</li><li>flat‧ten /ˈflætn/ :  <em>verb</em>  (also flatten out) [intransitive, transitive] to make something flat or flatter, or to become flat or flatter<br>Use a rolling pin to flatten the dough.<br>The land flattened out as we neared the coast.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I shall return when we are ready for you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”</p><p>She left the chamber. Harry <u>swallowed</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swal‧low /ˈswɒləʊ $ ˈswɑːloʊ/ :  <em>verb</em>  NERVOUSLY [intransitive] to make some of the liquid in your mouth go down your throat because you are frightened or nervous<br>Leo swallowed hard and walked into the room.<br>She swallowed nervously before beginning.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.</p><p>“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.”</p><p>Harry’s heart gave a horrible <u>jolt</u>. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers <u>wig</u> blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his <u>doom</u>.</p><blockquote><p>新生们以为分院仪式是一个测试，都紧张的不行。</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><p>jolt /dʒəʊlt $ dʒoʊlt/ :  <em>verb</em>  [intransitive, transitive] to move suddenly and roughly, or to make someone or something move in this way <strong>SYN:</strong> jerk<br>We jolted along rough wet roads through an endless banana plantation.</p></li><li><p>wig /wɪɡ/ :  <em>noun</em>  (wigged, wigging)  artificial hair that you wear on your head → toupée </p></li><li><p>doom /duːm/ :  <em>verb</em> something very bad that is going to happen, or the fact that it is going to happen<br>A sense of impending doom (=coming very soon) gripped her.<br>sense/feeling of doom<br>spell doom for something (=mean that something will be unable to continue or survive)<br> The recession spelled doom for many small businesses.<br> Thousands of soldiers met their doom (=died) on this very field.<br>doom and gloom/gloom and doom (=when there seems to be no hope for the future)<br> Despite these poor figures, it’s not all doom and gloom.</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>Then something happened that made him jump about a foot in the air — several people behind him screamed.</p><p>“What the — ?”</p><p>He <u>gasped</u>. So did the people around him. About twenty ghosts had just <u>streamed</u> through the back wall. Pearly-white and slightly <u>transparent</u>, they <u>glided</u> across the room talking to one another and hardly glancing at the first years. They seemed to be arguing. What looked like a fat little <u>monk</u> was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought to give him a second chance —”</p><blockquote><p>有大约二十个珍珠白的、透明的幽灵，透过墙壁，进入了他们所在的屋子里</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><p>gasp /ɡɑːsp $ ɡæsp/ :  <em>verb</em>  [intransitive, transitive] to breathe in suddenly in a way that can be heard, especially because you are surprised or in pain<br>gasp in/with<br>Ollie gasped with pain and slumped forward.<br>gasp at<br>The audience gasped at the splendour of the costumes.<br>‘My leg!’ he gasped. ‘I think it’s broken!’</p></li><li><p>stream /striːm/ :  <em>noun</em>  AIR/WATER a flow of water, air, smoke etc, or the direction in which it is flowing<br>A stream of cold air rushed through the open door.<br>→ Gulf Stream, jet stream</p></li><li><p>pearl‧y /ˈpɜːli $ ˈpɜːrli/ :  <em>adjective</em> pale in colour and shiny, like a <u>pearl</u><br>pearly white teeth<br>a pearly grey jacket</p></li><li><p>pearl /pɜːl $ pɜːrl/ :  <em>noun</em>  JEWEL [countable] a small round white object that forms inside an oyster, and is a valuable jewel<br>a pearl necklace<br>a string of pearls (=a necklace made of pearls)</p></li><li><p>trans‧par‧ent /trænˈspærənt, -ˈspeər- $ -ˈspær-, -ˈsper-/ :  <em>adjective</em>  if something is transparent, you can see through it <strong>SYN:</strong> clear, → opaque, translucent<br>a transparent plastic container</p></li><li><p>glide /ɡlaɪd/ :  <em>verb</em>  [always + adverb/preposition] to move smoothly and quietly, as if without effort<br>glide across/over/down etc<br>couples gliding over the dance floor</p></li><li><p>monk /mʌŋk/ :  <em>noun</em> a member of an all-male religious group that lives apart from other people in a monastery → nun </p></li></ul></blockquote><p>“My dear Friar, haven’t we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he’s not really even a ghost — I say, what are you all doing here?”</p><blockquote><p>Fat Friar 胖修士 说“原谅并忘记，我们应该再给他一次机会”</p><p>Peeves 皮皮鬼 很调皮，给胖修士起了很坏的外号。</p></blockquote><p>A ghost wearing a <u>ruff</u> and tights had suddenly noticed the first years.</p><blockquote><ul><li>ruff /rʌf/ :  <em>noun</em>  a stiff circular white collar, worn in the 16th century</li></ul></blockquote><p>Nobody answered.</p><p>“New students!” said the Fat Friar, smiling around at them. “About to be Sorted, I suppose?”</p><p>A few people nodded mutely.</p><p>“Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!” said the Friar. “My old House, you know.”</p><p>“Move along now,” said a sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony’s about to start.”</p><p>Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, the ghosts floated away through the opposite wall.</p><p>“Now, form a line,” Professor McGonagall told the first years, “and follow me.”</p><p>Feeling <u>oddly</u> as though his legs had turned to lead, Harry got into line behind a boy with <u>sandy</u> hair, with Ron behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>odd‧ly /ˈɒdli $ ˈɑːdli/ :  <em>adverb</em>  in a strange or unusual way <strong>SYN:</strong> strangely<br>She’s been behaving oddly this week.</p></li><li><p>sand‧y /ˈsændi/ :  <em>adjective</em>  hair that is sandy is a yellowish-brown colour </p></li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="2-The-Great-Hall-学校大厅"><a href="#2-The-Great-Hall-学校大厅" class="headerlink" title="2 The Great Hall 学校大厅"></a>2 The Great Hall 学校大厅</h2><p>Harry had never even imagined such a strange and <u>splendid</u> place. It was lit by thousands and thousands of candles that were floating <u>in midair</u> over four long tables, where the rest of the students were sitting. These tables were laid with <u>glittering</u> golden plates and <u>goblets</u>. At the top of the hall was another long table where the teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led the first years up here, so that they came to a <u>halt</u> in a line facing the other students, with the teachers behind them. The hundreds of faces staring at them looked like pale lanterns in the <u>flickering</u> <u>candlelight</u>. <u>Dotted</u> here and there among the students, the ghosts shone misty <u>silver</u>. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw a <u>velvety</u> black ceiling dotted with stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It’s <u>bewitched</u> to look like the sky outside. I read about it in Hogwarts, A History.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>splen‧did /ˈsplendɪd/ :  <em>adjective</em>  beautiful and impressive <strong>SYN:</strong> magnificent<br>All the rooms have splendid views.<br>a splendid cathedral</p></li><li><p>in midair:  in the air or the sky, away from the ground<br>The planes collided in midair.</p></li><li><p>glit‧ter‧ing /ˈɡlɪtərɪŋ/ :  <em>adjective</em>  giving off many small flashes of light <strong>SYN:</strong> sparkling<br> glittering jewels</p></li><li><p>gob‧let /ˈɡɒblɪt $ ˈɡɑːb-/ :  <em>noun</em> a cup made of glass or metal, with a base and a stem but no handle</p></li><li><p>halt /hɔːlt $ hɒːlt/ :  <em>noun</em>  [singular] a stop or pause<br> Heavy snowfalls brought traffic to a halt (=made it stop moving).<br>  The World Championship was brought to a temporary halt (=was stopped from continuing).<br> come/grind/screech etc to a halt (=stop moving or continuing)<br>  The whole peace process seems to have ground to a halt.<br>  The car skidded to a halt.<br>  The president has called for a halt to the wave of emigration.</p></li><li><p>flick‧er /ˈflɪkə $ -ər/ :  <em>verb</em>  an unsteady light that goes on and off quickly<br> flicker of<br>  the flicker of the firelight</p></li><li><p>can‧dle‧light /ˈkændl-laɪt/ :  <em>noun</em> the gentle light produced when a candle burns<br> The jewels sparkled in the candlelight.<br> by candlelight<br>  We ate by candlelight.</p></li><li><p>dot /dɒt $ dɑːt/ :  <em>noun</em>  (dotted, dotting)   something that looks like a small spot because it is so far away<br> The plane was just a dot on the horizon.</p></li><li><p>sil‧ver /ˈsɪlvə $ -ər/ :  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] a valuable shiny, light grey metal that is used to make jewellery, knives, coins etc. It is a chemical element: symbol Ag<br> a silver necklace<br>  cups made of solid silver</p></li><li><p>vel‧vet‧y /ˈvelvəti/ :  <em>adjective</em> looking, feeling, tasting, or sounding smooth and soft<br> the velvety texture of her skin<br>  His voice was soft and velvety.</p></li><li><p>be‧witch /bɪˈwɪtʃ/ :  <em>verb</em>  to get control over someone by putting a magic spell on them </p></li></ul></blockquote><p>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the <u>heavens</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>heav‧en /ˈhevən/ :  <em>noun</em>  PLACE OF GOD (also Heaven) [singular] the place where God is believed to live and where good people are believed to go when they die → paradise<br>in heaven<br>He believed that he and his wife would one day be together again in heaven.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged <u>stool</u> in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was <u>patched</u> and <u>frayed</u> and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stool /stuːl/ :  <em>noun</em><br>a seat that has three or four legs, but no back or arms<br>a bar stool</li></ul></blockquote><p>Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat <u>twitched</u>. A <u>rip</u> near the <u>brim</u> opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:</p><p>“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.</p><p>You can keep your <u>bowlers</u> black, Your top hats <u>sleek</u> and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can <u>cap</u> them all.</p><p>There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.</p><p>You might belong in Gryffindor, Where <u>dwell</u> the brave at heart, Their <u>daring</u>, nerve, and <u>chivalry</u> Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and <u>loyal</u>, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of <u>toil</u>; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of <u>wit</u> and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those <u>cunning</u> <u>folk</u> use any means To achieve their ends.</p><p>So put me on! Don’t be afraid!</p><p>And don’t get in a <u>flap</u>!</p><p>You’re in safe hands (though I have none) For I’m a Thinking Cap!”</p><p>The whole hall <u>burst</u> into <u>applause</u> as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.</p><p>“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about <u>wrestling</u> a <u>troll</u>.”</p><p>Harry smiled <u>weakly</u>. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-<u>witted</u> or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit <u>queasy</u>, that would have been the one for him.</p><p>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.</p><h2 id="3-Put-on-the-sorting-hat-戴上分院帽"><a href="#3-Put-on-the-sorting-hat-戴上分院帽" class="headerlink" title="3 Put on the sorting hat 戴上分院帽"></a>3 Put on the sorting hat 戴上分院帽</h2><p>“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”</p><p>A pink-faced girl with <u>blonde</u> <u>pigtails</u> stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —</p><blockquote><p>Abbott, Hannah 汉娜 艾博 是一个面色红润的女孩，</p></blockquote><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.</p><p>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.</p><p>“Bones, Susan!”</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.</p><p>“Boot, Terry!”</p><p>“RAVENCLAW!”</p><p>The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.</p><p>“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.</p><p>“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.</p><p>He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</p><p>“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”</p><p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p><p>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.</p><p>“Granger, Hermione!”</p><p>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.</p><p>“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</p><p>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?</p><p>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”</p><p>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”</p><p>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.</p><p>There weren’t many people left now.</p><p>“Moon” . . . , “Nott” . . . , “Parkinson” . . . , then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil” . . . , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” . . . , and then, at last —</p><p>“Potter, Harry!”</p><h2 id="4-Harry’s-turn-轮到哈利了"><a href="#4-Harry’s-turn-轮到哈利了" class="headerlink" title="4 Harry’s turn 轮到哈利了"></a>4 Harry’s turn 轮到哈利了</h2><p>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly <u>broke out</u> like little <u>hissing</u> fires all over the hall.</p><p>“Potter, did she say?”</p><p>“The Harry Potter?”</p><p>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people <u>craning</u> to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</p><p>“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice <u>thirst</u> to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?”</p><p>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.</p><p>“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”</p><p>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.</p><p>He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.</p><p>And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”</p><p>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.</p><p>“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.</p><p>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.</p><p>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</p><p>“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!</p><p>“Thank you!”</p><p>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.</p><p>“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.</p><p>“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”</p><h2 id="5-The-banquet-晚宴"><a href="#5-The-banquet-晚宴" class="headerlink" title="5 The banquet 晚宴"></a>5 The banquet 晚宴</h2><p>Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</p><p>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</p><p>“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.</p><p>“Can’t you — ?”</p><p>“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve in-troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”</p><p>“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”</p><p>“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</p><p>“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”</p><p>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.</p><p>“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”</p><p>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.</p><p>“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.</p><p>“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.</p><p>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . .</p><p>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.</p><p>“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”</p><p>The others laughed.</p><p>“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.</p><p>“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”</p><p>On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).</p><p>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.</p><p>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.</p><p>“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.</p><p>“What is it?” asked Percy.</p><p>“N-nothing.”</p><p>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.</p><p>“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.</p><p>“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”</p><p>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.</p><p>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</p><p>“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.</p><p>“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”</p><p>Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.</p><p>“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.</p><p>“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.</p><p>“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”</p><p>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</p><p>“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.</p><p>“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”</p><p>“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.</p><p>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.</p><p>“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”</p><p>And the school bellowed:</p><p>“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we’ve forgot, Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.”</p><p>Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.</p><p>“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”</p><h2 id="6-And-so-to-bed-噩梦"><a href="#6-And-so-to-bed-噩梦" class="headerlink" title="6 And so to bed 噩梦"></a>6 And so to bed 噩梦</h2><p>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.</p><p>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.</p><p>“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”</p><p>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.</p><p>“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”</p><p>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.</p><p>“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”</p><p>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</p><p>“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.</p><p>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.</p><p>“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”</p><p>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.</p><p>“Password?” she said.</p><p>“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.</p><p>Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.</p><p>“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”</p><p>Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</p><p>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</p><p>He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.</p>]]></content>

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half <u>furious</u>, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.</p><blockquote><ul><li>furious /ˈfʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (ANGRY)</em> extremely angry:<br>I was late and he was furious with me.<br>He’s furious about/at the way he’s been treated.<br>We had a furious debate about the death penalty.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig <u>swooping</u> in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to <u>vacuum</u> anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead <u>mice</u>. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry <u>ticked off</u> another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.</p><blockquote><p>哈利的猫头鹰叫 Hedwig （海德薇）</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><p>swoop /swuːp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to move very quickly and easily through the air, especially down from a high position in order to attack: 俯冲<br>The eagle swooped down to snatch a young rabbit.</p></li><li><p>vacuum /ˈvæk.juːm/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to use a vacuum cleaner to collect dust, dirt, etc.:</p><p>Vacuum (up) the cake crumbs, would you?</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/vacuum_noun_002_39800.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of vacuum"></p><ul><li>mice /ma：ɪs/: plural of mouse</li><li>ticked off:  <em>phrasal verb with tick verb</em>  to put a mark beside an item in a list to show that you have dealt with it:</li></ul></blockquote><p>On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a <u>quiz</u> show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.</p><blockquote><ul><li>quiz /kwɪz/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a game or competition in which you answer questions:竞猜<br>a history/sports, etc. quiz<br>There are so many inane television quiz shows.<br>UK A lot of pubs have quiz nights once or twice a week.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Er — Uncle Vernon?” Uncle Vernon <u>grunted</u> to show he was listening.</p><blockquote><ul><li>grunt /ɡrʌnt/: <em>noun (LOW SOUND)</em> (of a person) to make a short, low sound instead of speaking, usually because of anger or pain:哼了一声<br>He hauled himself over the wall, grunting with the effort.<br>[ + speech ] “Too tired,” he grunted and sat down.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon grunted again.</p><p>“Would it be all right if you <u>gave me a lift</u>?” Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.</p><blockquote><ul><li>lift /lɪft/: <em>noun [C] (JOURNEY)</em> a free trip in another person’s vehicle, esp. a car:<br>Can I give you a lift home?</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.</p><p>“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Harry didn’t say anything.</p><blockquote><ul><li>carpet /ˈkɑːr.pət/: <em>verb (COVER)</em> (a shaped piece of) thick material used for covering floors:地毯<br>We’ve just had a new carpet fitted/laid in our bedroom.<br>UK We’ve got fitted (= cut to fit exactly) carpets in the bedrooms.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/carpet_noun_002_05700.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of carpet"></p></blockquote><p>“Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.</p><p>“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.</p><p>His aunt and uncle <u>stared</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stare /ster/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking: 吃惊地瞪大眼睛<br>Don’t stare at people like that, it’s rude.<br>Chuck sat quietly for hours staring into the distance, thinking of what might have been.<br>During the press conference, each boxer tried to stare the other down (= force the other to look away by continual staring).</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.”</p><p>“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”</p><p>“It’s on my ticket.”</p><p>“<u>Barking</u>,” said Uncle Vernon, “<u>howling</u> <u>mad</u>, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>barking /ˈbɑːr.kɪŋ/: <em>adjective [ after verb ]</em> crazy or extremely silly:胡说<br>She must have been barking mad to lend him so much money.</li><li>howling /ˈhaʊ.lɪŋ/: <em>adjective (WIND)</em> (of the wind) blowing hard and making a lot of noise: 咆哮的<br>Once we played miniature golf in a howling gale.<br>The hurricane’s howling destructive winds just missed the island.</li><li>mad /mæd/: <em>*adjective</em> (SILLY)* extremely silly or stupid: 疯子<br>[ + to infinitive ] You’re mad to walk home alone at this time of night.<br>He must be mad spending all that money on a coat.<br>Some of the things she does are completely mad.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.</p><p>“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”</p><blockquote><p>电影没有交代，一直到哈利去学校，达利的尾巴还在屁股上，因此弗农夫妇准备带他去伦敦做手术，这才顺路带哈利去国王十字车站。</p></blockquote><p>Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s <u>robes</u> — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then <u>paced</u> the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy <u>trunk</u> had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.</p><blockquote><ul><li>robe /roʊb/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a long, loose piece of clothing worn especially on very formal occasions:<br>Judges wear black robes when they are in court.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/robe_noun_002_31345.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of robe"></p><ul><li>pace /peɪs/: <em>noun (SPEED)</em> the speed at which someone or something moves, or with which something happens or changes: 踱步<br>a slow/fast pace<br>When she thought she heard someone following her, she quickened her pace.<br>Could you slow down - I can’t keep pace with (= walk or run as fast as) you.<br>For many years this company has set the pace (= has been the most successful company) in the communications industry.<br>These changes seem to me to be happening at too fast a pace.<br>I don’t like the pace of modern life.</li><li>trunk /trʌŋk/: <em>noun (CONTAINER)</em> a large, strong container that is used for storing clothes and personal possessions, often when traveling or going to live in a new place</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/trunk_noun_002_39167.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of trunk"></p></blockquote><p>They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a <u>cart</u> and <u>wheeled</u> it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a <u>nasty</u> <u>grin</u> on his face.</p><blockquote><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of cart"></p><ul><li>wheel /wiːl/: <em>verb (PUSH)</em> to push an object that has wheels so that it moves in a particular direction:<br>I saw her last night wheeling a stroller along Green Lane.<br>Halfway through the talk someone wheeled in a cart with sandwiches .<br>Doctors put her on a respirator and wheeled her downstairs to intensive care.</li><li>nasty /ˈnæs.ti/: <em>adjective</em> bad or very unpleasant: 不怀好意的<br>a nasty shock/surprise<br>There’s a nasty smell in here.<br>He had a nasty cut above the eye.<br>She has a nasty habit of picking on people in meetings.</li><li>grin /ɡrɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a wide smile: 咧嘴笑<br>I assumed things had gone well for him because he had a big grin on his face.<br>a broad/sheepish grin</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/grin_noun_002_16558.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of grin"></p></blockquote><p>“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”</p><p>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</p><p>“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even <u>nastier</u> smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.</p><blockquote><ul><li>nasty /ˈnæs.ti/: <em>adjective</em> bad or very unpleasant: 不怀好意的<br>a nasty shock/surprise<br>There’s a nasty smell in here.<br>He had a nasty cut above the eye.<br>She has a nasty habit of picking on people in meetings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>He stopped a passing <u>guard</u>, but didn’t <u>dare</u> mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard <u>strode</u> away, <u>muttering</u> about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was <u>stranded</u> in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.</p><blockquote><ul><li>guard /ɡɑːrd/: <em>noun (PERSON WHO PROTECTS)</em> a person or group of people whose job is to protect a person, place, or thing from danger or attack, or to prevent a person such as a criminal from escaping: 守卫<br>prison guards<br>security guards<br>There are guards posted (= standing and watching) at every entrance.<br>Armed guards are posted around the site.<br>The frontier is patrolled by border guards.</li><li>dare /der/: <em>verb (BE BRAVE/RUDE)</em> to be brave enough to do something difficult or dangerous, or to be rude or silly enough to do something that you have no right to do:<br>I was going to ask if his dog was better, but I didn’t dare in case she had died.<br>[ + (to) infinitive ] Everyone in the office complains that he smells awful, but nobody dares (to) mention it to him.<br>[ + infinitive without to ] I wouldn’t dare have a party in my apartment in case the neighbors complained.<br>Dare you tell him the news?<br>I don’t dare think how much it’s going to cost.<br>UK I daren’t think how much it’s going to cost.<br>UK Do you dare (to) tell him the news?<br>I’d never dare (to) talk to my mother the way Brandon talks to his.<br>[ + to infinitive ] He was under attack for daring to criticize the mayor.</li><li>stride /straɪd/: <em>noun (STEP)</em> a long step when walking or running: 大步<br>She attributes her record-breaking speed to the length of her stride.</li><li>mutter /ˈmʌt̬.ɚ/: <em>noun (QUIET WORDS)</em> to speak quietly and in a low voice that is not easy to hear, often when you are worried or complaining about something: 嘀咕<br>Stop muttering and speak up!<br>He was muttering (away) to himself.<br>Laurence muttered something about his wife and left.<br>He muttered something under his breath to the person next to him.</li><li>stranded /ˈstræn.dɪd/: <em>adjective</em> unable to leave somewhere because of a problem such as not having any transportation or money: 进退两难的<br>He left me stranded downtown with no car and no money for a bus.<br>If the tide comes in, we’ll be stranded on these rocks.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third <u>brick</u> on the left to get into Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket <u>inspector</u>’s stand between platforms nine and ten.</p><blockquote><ul><li>brick /brɪk/: <em>noun (BUILDING BLOCK)</em> a rectangular block of hard material used for building walls and houses:<br>The chimney was made of bricks.<br>red-brick houses<br>He was so embarrassed - his face went brick-red (= a dark red).</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brick_noun_002_04555.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of brick"></p><ul><li>inspector /ɪnˈspek.tɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> someone whose job is to officially inspect something: 检查员<br>a tax inspector<br>a school inspector/an inspector of schools</li></ul></blockquote><p>At that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying.</p><p>“— <u>packed with</u> Muggles, of course —”</p><blockquote><ul><li>pack sth with sth/sb: to fill something with things or people of a particular type:<br>We have packed the conference with an exciting line-up of interesting speakers.<br>When president of the Society, he had packed the committee with his supporters.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry <u>swung</u> round. The speaker was a <u>plump</u> woman who was talking to four boys, all with flaming red hair. Each of them was pushing a trunk like Harry’s in front of him — and they had an owl.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swung /swʌŋ/: <em>verb</em> past simple and past participle of swing 转身</li><li>plump /plʌmp/: <em>adjective</em> having a pleasantly soft, rounded body or shape: 圆胖的<br>a nice plump chicken<br>plump juicy grapes<br>a child with plump rosy cheeks</li></ul></blockquote><p>Heart <u>hammering</u>, Harry pushed his cart after them.

Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came <u>swarming</u> in front of him and by the time the last <u>backpack</u> had cleared away, the boy had vanished.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swarm /swɔːrm/: <em>noun</em> a large group of insects all moving together: 人群<br>a swarm of bees/wasps/ants/locusts<br>The dead sheep was covered with swarms of flies.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/swarm_noun_002_36913.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of swarm"></p><ul><li>backpack /ˈbæk.pæk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a large bag used to carry things on your back, used especially by people who go camping or walking:<br>It’s a frame backpack with a belt and padded shoulder straps.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/backpa_noun_002_02242.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of backpack"></p></blockquote><p>“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.</p><p>“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?</p><p>Now the third brother was walking <u>briskly</u> toward the barrier he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.</p><blockquote><ul><li>brisk /brɪsk/: <em>adjective</em> quick, energetic, and active: 迅速的<br>a brisk walk<br>He set a brisk pace and we struggled to keep up.<br>Her tone on the phone was brisk (= she spoke quickly and used few words) and businesslike.</li></ul></blockquote><p>There was nothing else for it.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.</p><p>“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts?

People <u>jostled</u> him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to <u>smash</u> right into that <u>barrier</u> and then he’d be in trouble — <u>leaning</u> forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.</p><blockquote><ul><li>jostle /ˈdʒɑː.səl/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to knock or push roughly against someone in order to move past them or get more space when you are in a crowd of people: 冲撞<br>As we came into the arena, we were jostled by fans pushing their way toward the stage.<br>Photographers jostled and shoved to get a better view of the royal couple.</li><li>smash /smæʃ/: <em>verb (MOVE FORCEFULLY)</em> to cause something to move with great force against something hard, usually causing damage or injury:<br>Several boats were smashed against the rocks during the storm.<br>He tried to smash the door down to get to me.<br>The car was traveling very fast when it smashed into the tree.<br>He threatened to smash my face in if I didn’t give him the money.</li><li>barrier /ˈber.i.ɚ/: <em>noun</em> a gate in some railroad stations through which you must go to get on a train: 站台<br>Passengers are requested to show their tickets at the barrier.</li><li>leaning: 倾斜</li></ul></blockquote><p>A <u>scarlet</u> steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock. Harry looked behind him and saw a <u>wrought-iron</u> <u>archway</u> where the barrier had been, with the words Platform Nine and Three-Quarters on it. He had done it.</p><blockquote><ul><li>scarlet /ˈskɑːr.lət/: <em>noun [ U ], adjective</em> bright red:<br>scarlet berries<br>He went scarlet with shame.</li><li>steam engine: 蒸汽机车</li><li>wrought iron /ˌrɑːt ˈaɪrn/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> iron that can be bent into attractive shapes and used to make gates, furniture, etc.: 锻铁<br>wrought-iron gates</li><li>archway /ˈɑːrtʃ.weɪ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> an entrance or passage formed by an arch 拱门</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/archwa_noun_002_01520.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of archway"></p></blockquote><p>Smoke from the engine drifted over the heads of the <u>chattering</u> crowd, while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs.

Harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat. He passed a round-faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I’ve lost my <u>toad</u> again.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>toad /toʊd/: <em>noun (ANIMAL)</em> a small, brown animal, similar to a frog, that has big eyes and long back legs for swimming and jumping:<br>Toads have drier, lumpier skins than frogs and spend less time in the water.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/toad_noun_002_38261.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of toad"></p></blockquote><p>“Oh, Neville,” he heard the old woman sigh.</p><p>A boy with <u>dreadlocks</u> was surrounded by a small crowd.</p><blockquote><p>纳威出现！</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>dreadlocks /ˈdred.lɑːks/: <em>noun [ plural ]</em> a hairstyle in which the hair hangs in long thick twisted pieces:<br>The 39-year-old photographer wears his hair in dreadlocks.<br>I wanted to have dreadlocks like Bob Marley.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/dreadl_noun_002_11535.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of dreadlocks"></p></blockquote><p>“Give us a look, Lee, go on.”</p><blockquote><p>李出现。他留着“骇人”长发绺（长发结成辫，四下垂散的一种发型）。哈利第一次见到他的时候，他在捉弄身边的人。</p></blockquote><p>The boy lifted the <u>lid</u> of a box in his arms, and the people around him <u>shrieked</u> and yelled as something inside poked out a long, hairy leg.</p><blockquote><ul><li>lid /lɪd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a cover on a container, that can be lifted up or removed: 盖子<br>Can you get the lid off this jar?<br>Put a lid on the saucepan.</li><li>shriek /ʃriːk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a short, loud, high cry, especially one produced suddenly as an expression of a powerful emotion: 尖叫<br>shrieks of delight<br>He suddenly let out a piercing shriek.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty <u>compartment</u> near the end of the train.

Finally, with the help of Miguel, she remembered her father again and left the Land of the Living happily.</p><h2 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h2><p>Leaving the family home behind, Miguel breathed the <u>crisp</u> air of another sunny morning in Santa Cecilia.</p><blockquote><ul><li>crisp /krɪsp/: <em>adjective (HARD)</em> hard enough to be broken easily</li></ul></blockquote><p>As he headed into town with his <u>shoeshine</u> box, he passed a woman sweeping a <u>stoop</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>shoeshine /ˈʃuːˌʃaɪn/:  n<ul><li>the act or an instance of polishing a pair of shoes</li></ul><ol start="2"><li>the appearance or shiny surface of polished shoes</li></ol></li><li>stoop /stuːp/: <em>noun (STEPS)</em> to bend the top half of the body forward and down:<br>The doorway was so low that we had to stoop to go through it.<br>Something fell out of her coat pocket and she stooped down and picked it up.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stoop_noun_002_36045.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stoop"></p></blockquote><p>She waved.</p><p>“Hola, Miguel!”</p><blockquote><ul><li>hola : <em>informal</em>. （Spanish）hello</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Hola.” Miguel waved back.</p><p>Closer to town, Miguel smiled at a lone guitar player <u>plucking away at a song</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>pluck /plʌk/: <em>verb (REMOVE)</em> to pull something, especially with a sudden movement, in order to remove it:<br>Caged birds sometimes pluck out their breast feathers.<br>He plucked the letter from/out of my hand, and ran off with it.<br>Do you pluck your eyebrows (= remove some of the hairs from them to give them a better shape)?</li></ul></blockquote><p>The <u>farther</u> in Miguel went, the more music f illed the air.</p><blockquote><ul><li>farther /ˈfɑːr.ðɚ/: <em>adverb</em> comparative of far : to a greater distance:<br>How much farther is it to the airport?<br>The fog’s so thick, I can’t see farther than about ten feet.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Church bells chimed in harmony. A band played an upbeat tune. A radio blared a swift cumbia rhythm.</p><p>Miguel soaked it all in.</p><p>He couldn’t help <u>tapping</u> out a beat on a table covered with brightly colored wooden animal <u>figurines</u>.</p><p>As Miguel rushed past another stand with <u>pastries</u> for sale, he grabbed a pan <u>dulce</u> and tossed the vendor a coin.</p><p>Smelling the sweet bread, Miguel’s canine <u>sidekick</u>, Dante, sidled up to him.</p><p>Miguel tore off a piece of the bread and Dante <u>chomped</u> it down.</p><p>Everywhere Miguel looked, people were preparing for their loved ones to return from the Land of the Dead by hanging colorful <u>papel</u> <u>picado</u> and laying <u>marigold</u> <u>petals</u> at their doorways.</p><p>As usual, Mariachi Plaza was full of musicians strolling around, waiting for their chance to serenade a couple or a family with a love song or a classic <u>corrido</u>.</p><p>Soon a tour group gathered around a large statue of a mariachi player in the center of the plaza.</p><p>“And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his f irst steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history,” said the guide.</p><p>Everyone in the group nodded, familiar with the legendary musician and singer.</p><p>Along with the tourists, Miguel gazed up at the statue.</p><p>He’d seen it a hundred times, but it always inspired him.</p><p>After a moment, Miguel found a spot in the plaza and pulled out his shoeshine box.</p><p>A mariachi plopped down for a shine.</p><p>Miguel knew the mariachi would enjoy this story.</p><p>After all, everyone loved Ernesto.</p><p>“He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me,” said Miguel.</p><p>“But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar. He could f ly!”</p><p>Miguel had seen that special effect in some old f ilm clips.</p><p>“And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It’s—“</p><p>Miguel gestured to some musicians nearby, who were playing “Remember Me,” Ernesto’s biggest hit.</p><p>“He lived the kind of life you dream about. Until 1942, when he was crushed by a giant bell.”</p><p>The mariachi looked pointedly at his shoes, which Miguel was only halfheartedly shining.</p><p>Ignoring the musician, Miguel shrugged off Ernesto’s unfortunate death.</p><p>“I wanna be just like him. Sometimes I look at Ernesto and I get this feeling, like we’re connected somehow. Like if he could play music, maybe someday I can, too.”</p><p>Miguel sighed. “If it wasn’t for my family.”</p><p>“Ay-yi-yi, muchacho,” said the mariachi, snapping Miguel out of his story.</p><p>“Huh?” said Miguel.</p><p>“I asked for a shoeshine, not your life story,” replied the mariachi.</p><p>“Oh, yeah, sorry.” Miguel lowered his head and polished the man’s shoe.</p><p>As he worked, the mariachi casually plucked at his guitar strings.</p><p>“I just can’t really talk about any of this at home, so—“</p><p>“Look, if I were you? I’d march right up to my family and say, ‘Hey! I’m a musician. Deal with it’. “</p><p>“I could never say that.”</p><p>“You ARE a musician, no?”</p><p>“I don’t know. I mean, I only really play for myself—“</p><p>“Ahh!” the mariachi howled.</p><p>“Did Ernesto de la Cruz become the world’s best musician by hiding his sweet, sweet skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud!”</p><p>The mariachi pointed to the gazebo, where a giant canvas that read talent show was being unfurled.</p><p>“Ah! Mira, mira! They’re setting up for tonight. The music competition for Día de los Muertos. You wanna be like your hero? You should sign up!”</p><p>“Uh-uh—my family would freak,” Miguel said.</p><p>“Look, if you’re too scared, then, well, have fun making shoes.”</p><p>The mariachi shrugged.</p><p>“C’mon, what did Ernesto de la Cruz always say?”</p><p>“‘Seize your moment’?” Miguel said.</p><p>The mariachi looked Miguel over and then offered him his guitar.</p><p>“Show me what you got, muchacho. I’ll be your f irst audience.”</p><p>Miguel’s eyebrows rose.</p><p>The mariachi really wanted to hear him play?</p><p>He glanced down the street to make sure the coast was clear of any family members.</p><p>He reached for the guitar.</p><p>Once it was cradled in his arms, Miguel spread his f ingers across the strings, anticipating his chord, and— “Miguel!” a familiar voice yelled.</p><p>Miguel gasped and threw the guitar back into the mariachi’s lap.</p><p>Abuelita marched toward him.</p><p>Tío Berto and Prima Rosa followed close behind with supplies from the market.</p><p>“Abuelita!” Miguel exclaimed.</p><p>“What are you doing here?” she asked.</p><p>“Um. . . uh. . . ,” Miguel stammered as he quickly packed away his shine rag and polishes.</p><p>Abuelita didn’t wait for Miguel’s answer.</p><p>She barreled up to the mariachi and struck him with her shoe.</p><p>“You leave my grandson alone!”</p><p>“Doña, please—I was just getting a shine!”</p><p>“I know your tricks, mariachi!” She glared at Miguel. “What did he say to you?”</p><p>“He was just showing me his guitar,” Miguel said sheepishly.</p><p>His family gasped.</p><p>“Shame on you!” Tío Berto barked at the mariachi.</p><p>Abuelita’s shoe was aimed directly at the area between the musician’s eyes.</p><p>“My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito—he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him!” she threatened.</p><p>Miguel wasn’t so sure he was the sweet little angel from heaven she’d described, but he wasn’t going to argue when she was gripping her shoe like that.</p><p>The mariachi scampered away, pulling on his hat before leaving.</p><p>Miguel watched apologetically over his abuelita’s shoulder.</p><p>“Ay, pobrecito!”</p><p>Abuelita pulled her grandson protectively to her bosom.</p><p>“Estás bien, m’ijo?” Miguel gasped for air.</p><p>“You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now!” she ordered, and turned away from the plaza.</p><p>Miguel sighed and gathered his shine box.</p><p>He spotted a plaza talent-show f lyer on the ground.</p><p>Behind his abuelita’s back, he snatched it up and put it in his pocket.</p>]]></content>

I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children– although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p><p>To Leon Werth</p><p>when he was a little boy</p><blockquote><ul><li>indulgence /ɪnˈdʌl.dʒəns/: <em>noun</em> an occasion when you allow someone or yourself to have something enjoyable, especially more than is good for you:<br>Chocolate is my only indulgence.<br>All the pleasures and indulgences of the weekend are over, and I must get down to some serious hard work.<br>His health suffered from over-indulgence in (= too much) rich food and drink.</li><li>dedicate /ˈded.ə.keɪt/: <em>verb (GIVE TIME/ENERGY)</em> to give all of your energy, time, etc.:<br>He has dedicated his life to scientific research.<br>The new president said she would dedicate herself to protecting the rights of the sick and the homeless.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h2><p>- we are introduced to the <u>narrator</u>, a pilot, and his ideas about grown-ups</p><blockquote><ul><li>narrator /ˈner.eɪ.t̬ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the character who tells you what is happening in a book or movie</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="1-1-当个画家"><a href="#1-1-当个画家" class="headerlink" title="1-1 当个画家"></a>1-1 当个画家</h3><p>Once when I was six years old I saw a <u>magnificent</u> picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the <u>primeval</u> forest. It was a picture of a <u>boa constrictor</u> in the act of <u>swallowing</u> an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>magnificent /mæɡˈnɪf.ə.sənt/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very good, beautiful, or deserving to be admired:<br>a magnificent view<br>a magnificent piece of writing<br>They live in a magnificent Tudor house.</li><li><strong>primeval /praɪˈmiː.vəl/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> ancient; existing at or from a very early time:<br>primeval forests</li><li><strong>bo‧a /ˈbəʊə $ ˈboʊə/ constrictor /kənˈstrɪk.tɚ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> a large snake that is not poisonous, but kills animals by crushing them</li><li><strong>swal‧low /ˈswɒləʊ $ ˈswɑːloʊ/ :</strong>  <em>verb</em>  FOOD [intransitive, transitive] to make food or drink go down your throat and towards your stomach<br>He swallowed the last of his coffee and asked for the bill.<br> Most snakes swallow their prey whole.</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285407432035.jpg" alt="《小王子》图片 ---- 一条蟒蛇正在吞食一只大野兽"></p><p>In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without <u>chewing</u> it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for <u>digestion</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>chew /tʃuː/</strong> :  <em>verb</em>  [intransitive, transitive] to bite food several times before swallowing it<br>This meat’s so tough I can hardly chew it!<br>chew at/on<br> a dog chewing on a bone</p></li><li><p><strong>di‧ges‧tion /daɪˈdʒestʃən, də-/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] the process of digesting food </p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I <u>pondered</u> deeply, then, over the <u>adventures</u> of the <u>jungle</u>. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ponder /ˈpɑːn.dɚ/</strong>: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to think carefully about something, especially for a noticeable length of time:<br>She sat back for a minute to ponder her next move in the game.</li><li><strong>ad‧ven‧ture /ədˈventʃə $ -ər/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  an exciting experience in which dangerous or unusual things happen<br>a great adventure<br> Ahab’s adventures at sea<br> an adventure story</li><li><strong>jun‧gle /ˈdʒʌŋɡəl/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  [countable, uncountable] a thick tropical forest with many large plants growing very close together<br>the Amazon jungle</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285507432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第一号作品"></p><p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p><p>But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?”</p><p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285607432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第二号作品"></p><p>The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, <u>arithmetic</u> and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.</p><blockquote><ul><li>a‧rith‧me‧tic /əˈrɪθmətɪk/ :  <em>noun</em> the science of numbers involving adding, multiplying etc → mathematics </li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="1-2-通情达理之人"><a href="#1-2-通情达理之人" class="headerlink" title="1-2 通情达理之人"></a>1-2 通情达理之人</h3><p>I had been <u>disheartened</u> by the <u>failure</u> of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is <u>tiresome</u> for <u>children</u> to be always and forever explaining things to them.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>dis‧heart‧ened /dɪsˈhɑːtnd $ -ɑːrtnd/</strong> :  <em>adjective</em> disappointed, so that you lose hope and the determination to continue doing something<br>If young children don’t see quick results they grow disheartened.</p></li><li><p>fail‧ure /ˈfeɪljə $ -ər/ :  <em>noun</em>  LACK OF SUCCESS [countable, uncountable] a lack of success in achieving or doing something <strong>OPP:</strong> success</p></li><li><p><strong>draw‧ing /ˈdrɔːɪŋ $ ˈdrɒː-/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  [countable] a picture that you draw with a pencil, pen etc<br>drawing of<br> a drawing of Canterbury Cathedral</p></li><li><p><strong>tiresome /ˈtaɪr.səm/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> annoying and making you lose patience:<br>I find it very tiresome doing the same job day after day.<br>He has the tiresome habit of finishing your sentences for you.</p></li><li><p><strong>chil‧dren /ˈtʃɪldrən/</strong> :  the plural of child </p></li></ul></blockquote><p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a <u>glance</u> I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is <u>valuable</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>glance /ɡlɑːns $ ɡlæns/</strong> :  <em>verb</em>  to quickly look at someone or something<br>glance at/up/down etc</li><li>valuable /ˈvæl.jə.bəl/: <em>adjective (MONEY)</em> worth a lot of money:<br>These antiques are extremely valuable.<br>This is losing valuable business for the company.</li></ul></blockquote><p><u>In the course of</u> this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with <u>matters of consequence.</u> I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them <u>intimately</u>, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Matters of consequence</strong>, on the contrary, indicate responsibilities, referring to the cause and effect of one’s behavior. Woods’s decision indicates her moralistic interpretation of the text, her response to the time, and, therefore, “<strong>matters of consequence</strong>” is her peculiar euphemism for war.</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li>in (the) course of time:  after some or enough time has passed <strong>SYN:</strong> eventually<br>She’ll get used to school in the course of time.</li><li>in‧ti‧mate /ˈɪntəmət/ :  <em>adjective</em>  FRIENDS having an extremely close friendship<br>an intimate friend of Picasso’s<br>an intimate relationship<br>She’s on intimate terms with people in government.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:    </p><p>“That is a hat.”</p><p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or <u>primeval</u> forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and <u>neckties</u>. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a <u>sensible</u> man.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>primeval /praɪˈmiː.vəl/: <em>adjective</em> ancient; existing at or from a very early time:<br>primeval forests</p></li><li><p>neck‧tie /ˈnektaɪ/ :  <em>noun</em> a man’s tie</p></li><li><p>sen‧si‧ble /ˈsensəbəl/ :  <em>adjective</em>  reasonable, practical, and showing good judgment<br>She seems very sensible.<br> sensible advice<br> It’s sensible to keep a note of your passport number.<br> Moving house seemed like the sensible thing to do.</p></li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-2"><a href="#Chapter-2" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2"></a>Chapter 2</h2><h3 id="2-1-无烟的沙漠"><a href="#2-1-无烟的沙漠" class="headerlink" title="2-1 无烟的沙漠"></a>2-1 无烟的沙漠</h3><p>- the narrator crashes in the desert and makes the acquaintance of the little prince</p><p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of <u>Sahara</u>, six years ago. Something was broken in my <u>engine</u>. And as I had with me neither a <u>mechanic</u> nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had <u>scarcely</u> enough drinking water to last a week.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Sa‧ha‧ra, the /səˈhɑːrə $ -ˈhæ-/</strong> :  the world’s largest desert which covers a very large area of North Africa. Some scientists believe that the desert is gradually becoming bigger. </li><li><strong>en‧gine /ˈendʒɪn/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  the part of a vehicle that produces power to make it move → motor<br>start/switch on an engine</li><li><strong>me‧chan‧ic /mɪˈkænɪk/</strong> :  <em>noun</em><br>[countable] someone who is skilled at repairing motor vehicles and machinery<br> a garage mechanic</li><li><strong>scarce‧ly /ˈskeəsli $ ˈsker-/</strong> :  <em>adverb</em>  almost not or almost none at all <strong>SYN:</strong> hardly<br>The city had scarcely changed in 20 years.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a <u>shipwrecked</u> <u>sailor</u> on a <u>raft</u> in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can <u>imagine</u> my amazement, at sunrise, when I was <u>awakened</u> by an <u>odd</u> little voice. It said:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ship‧wreck /ˈʃɪp-rek/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  [countable, uncountable] the destruction of a ship in an accident<br>survivors of the shipwreck<br>narrowly escaping shipwreck</li><li>sail‧or /ˈseɪlə $ -ər/ :  <em>noun</em>  someone who works on a ship<br> Six British sailors drowned.<br>  We were both experienced sailors.</li><li>raft /rɑːft $ ræft/ :  <em>noun</em>  a flat floating structure, usually made of pieces of wood tied together, used as a boat </li><li><strong>i‧ma‧gine /ɪˈmædʒɪn/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to form a picture or idea in your mind about what something could be like<br> imagine (that)<br>  Imagine that you have just won a million pounds.<br>  Imagine life without hot water.</li><li><strong>a‧wak‧en /əˈweɪkən/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  [intransitive, transitive] to wake up or to make someone wake up<br> She was awakened by a noise at two in the morning.<br>  Bill slept a little until he was awakened to take his turn on guard.<br> Register<br> In everyday English, people usually use wake up rather than awaken:<br> She was woken up by the phone ringing.</li><li><strong>odd /ɒd $ ɑːd/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  (comparative odder, superlative oddest)   STRANGE different from what is normal or expected, especially in a way that you disapprove of or cannot understand<br> It was an odd thing to say.<br>  an odd way to behave</li></ul></blockquote><p>“If you please– draw me a sheep!”</p><p>“What!”</p><p>“Draw me a sheep!”</p><p>I jumped to my feet, completely <u>thunderstruck</u>. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great <u>seriousness</u>. Here you may see the best <u>portrait</u> that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less <u>charming</u> than its model.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>thun‧der‧struck /ˈθʌndəstrʌk $ -ər-/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> extremely surprised or shocked<br>Jeff looked thunderstruck when he saw me.</li><li>se‧ri‧ous‧ness /ˈsɪəriəsnəs $ ˈsɪr-/ :  <em>noun</em>  the quality of being serious</li><li><strong>portrait /ˈpɔːr.trɪt/</strong>: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a painting, photograph, drawing, etc. of a person or, less commonly, of a group of people:<br>She’s commissioned an artist to paint her portrait/paint a portrait of her.<br>a portrait gallery<br>a portrait painter</li><li>charming /ˈtʃɑːr.mɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> pleasant and attractive:<br>We had dinner with our director and his charming wife.<br>What a charming street this is.</li></ul></blockquote><p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285707432035.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>Now I stared at this sudden <u>apparition</u> with my eyes <u>fairly</u> starting out of my head in <u>astonishment</u>. </p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ap‧pa‧ri‧tion /ˌæpəˈrɪʃən/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> something that you imagine you can see, especially the spirit of a dead person<br>He stared at the strange apparition before him.<br>a ghostly apparition of a man</li><li>fair‧ly /ˈfeəli $ ˈferli/ :  <em>adverb</em>  [+adj/adverb] more than a little, but much less than very → quite<br>The house had a fairly large garden.<br>She speaks English fairly well.<br>The instructions seem fairly straightforward.</li><li><strong>as‧ton‧ish‧ment /əˈstɒnɪʃmənt $ əˈstɑː-/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> complete surprise <strong>SYN:</strong> amazement<br>in astonishment<br>She stared at him in astonishment.<br> to somebody’s astonishment<br>To my astonishment, the car was gone.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="2-2-画一头羊"><a href="#2-2-画一头羊" class="headerlink" title="2-2 画一头羊"></a>2-2 画一头羊</h3><p>Remember, I had crashed in the <u>desert</u> a thousand miles from any <u>inhabited</u> <u>region</u>. </p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>des‧ert /ˈdezət $ -ərt/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>[countable, uncountable] a large area of land where it is always very dry, there are few plants, and there is a lot of sand or rocks<br> the Sahara Desert<br> This area of the country is mostly desert.<br>in the desert<br> The plane crash-landed in the desert.</li><li><strong>in‧hab‧it /ɪnˈhæbɪt/</strong>:  <em>verb</em> if animals or people inhabit an area or place, they live there <strong>SYN:</strong> live<br>The woods are inhabited by many wild animals.<br> inhabited islands</li><li><strong>re‧gion /ˈriːdʒən/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a large area of a country or of the world, usually without exact limits <strong>SYN:</strong> area<br>efforts to bring peace to the region<br> region of<br>the Choco region of Columbia<br> coastal/border/central etc region<br>Flooding is likely in some coastal regions of the Northeast during the early part of the week.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And yet my little man seemed neither to be <u>straying</u> uncertainly among the sands, nor to be <u>fainting</u> from <u>fatigue</u> or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>stray /streɪ/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to move away from the place you should be<br>stray into/onto/from<br> Three of the soldiers strayed into enemy territory.</li><li><strong>faint /feɪnt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  to suddenly become unconscious for a short time <strong>SYN:</strong> pass out<br>Several fans fainted in the blazing heat.</li><li>fatigue /fəˈtiːɡ/: <em>noun (TIREDNESS/WEAKNESS)</em> extreme tiredness:<br>She was suffering from fatigue.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“But– what are you doing here?”</p><p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: “If you please– draw me a sheep…”</p><p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:</p><p>“That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep…”</p><p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,</p><p>“No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very <u>cumbersome</u>. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”</p><p>So then I made a drawing.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285807432035.jpg" alt="这只羊已经病得很重了。"></p><h3 id="2-3-结识小王子"><a href="#2-3-结识小王子" class="headerlink" title="2-3 结识小王子"></a>2-3 结识小王子</h3><p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p><p>“No. This sheep is already very <u>sickly</u>. Make me another.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>sick‧ly /ˈsɪkli/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  a sickly person or animal is weak, unhealthy, and often ill<br>a sickly child<br>She looked pale and sickly.</li></ul></blockquote><p>So I made another drawing.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285907432035.jpg" alt="你画的不是小羊，是头公羊，还有犄角呢。"></p><p>My friend smiled gently and <u>indulgenty</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>in‧dul‧gent /ɪnˈdʌldʒənt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> willing to allow someone, especially a child, to do or have whatever they want, even if this is not good for them<br>toys bought by their indulgent grandparents</li></ul></blockquote><p>“You see yourself,” he said, “that this is not a sheep. This is a <u>ram</u>. It has <u>horns</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ram /ræm/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (rammed, ramming)<br>an adult male sheep → ewe</li><li><strong>horn /hɔːn $ hɔːrn/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>ANIMAL<br>a) [countable] the hard pointed thing that grows, usually in pairs, on the heads of animals such as cows and goats → antlers<br>b) [uncountable] the substance that animals’ horns are made of<br> a knife with a horn handle<br>c) [countable] a part of an animal’s head that sticks out like a horn, for example on a snail</li></ul></blockquote><p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/286007432036.jpg" alt="这一只太老了。"></p><p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p><p>“This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.”</p><p>By this time my <u>patience</u> was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I <u>tossed</u> off this drawing.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>pa‧tience /ˈpeɪʃəns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  the ability to continue waiting or doing something for a long time without becoming angry or anxious <strong>OPP:</strong> impatience<br>I wouldn’t have the patience to sit sewing all day.<br> infinite/unlimited/endless patience<br>a good listener who has infinite patience</li><li><strong>toss /tɒs $ tɒːs/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  [transitive] to throw something, especially something light, with a quick gentle movement of your hand<br> toss something into/onto etc something<br>  She crumpled the letter and tossed it into the fire.<br> toss something aside/over etc<br>  Toss that book over, will you?<br> toss something to somebody<br>  ‘Catch!’ said Sandra, tossing her bag to him.<br> toss somebody something<br>  Frank tossed her the newspaper.</li></ul></blockquote><p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/286107432036.jpg" alt="这是一只箱子，你要的羊就在里面。"></p><p>“This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.”</p><p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p><p>“That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Because where I live everything is very small…”</p><p>“There will surely be enough grass for him,” I said. “It is a very small sheep that I have given you.”</p><p>He <u>bent</u> his head over the drawing:</p><p>“Not so small that– Look! He has gone to sleep…”</p><p>And that is how I made the <u>acquaintance</u> of the little <u>prince</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>bend /bend/: <em>verb (CURVE)</em> to (cause to) curve:<br>The road bends to the left after the traffic lights.</li><li><strong>ac‧quaint‧ance /əˈkweɪntəns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  RELATIONSHIP [singular, uncountable] a relationship with someone you know, but who is not a close friend<br>They developed an acquaintance over the Internet.<br> You can’t judge her on such short acquaintance (=when you have not known her long).<br> My uncle did not improve on further acquaintance (=when you knew him better).</li><li>prince /prɪns/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> an important male member of a royal family, especially a son or grandson of the king or queen:<br>Prince Edward<br>Prince Juan Carlos of Spain became king in 1975.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-3"><a href="#Chapter-3" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3"></a>Chapter 3</h2><p>- the narrator learns more about from where the little prince came</p><h3 id="3-1-我的飞机"><a href="#3-1-我的飞机" class="headerlink" title="3-1 我的飞机"></a>3-1 我的飞机</h3><p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p><p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p><p>“What is that object?”</p><p>“That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.”</p><p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p><p>He cried out, then:</p><p>“What!

I knew very well that in addition to the great planets– such as the Earth, <u>Jupiter</u>, <u>Mars</u>, <u>Venus</u>– to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, “Asteroid 3251.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>Ju‧pi‧ter /ˈdʒuːpɪtə $ -ər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> the planet that is fifth in order from the Sun and is the largest in the solar system<br> a space probe on its way to Jupiter</li><li><strong>Mars /mɑːz $ mɑːrz/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> the small red planet that is fourth in order from the Sun and is nearest the Earth → Martian<br>the enormous volcanoes known to exist on Mars</li><li><strong>Ve‧nus /ˈviːnəs/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> the planet that is second in order from the Sun<br>the high surface temperatures of Venus</li></ul></blockquote><p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p><p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish <u>astronomer</u>, in 1909.</p><blockquote><ul><li>asteroid /ˈæs.tə.rɔɪd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> one of many large rocks that circle the sun</li><li><strong>as‧tron‧o‧mer /əˈstrɒnəmə $ əˈstrɑːnəmər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> a scientist who studies the stars and planets </li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/281707402032.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说土耳其天文学家图片"></p><p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical <u>Congress</u>, in a great demonstration.

If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.” And what good would it do to tell them that? They would <u>shrug</u> their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: “The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,” then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>shrug /ʃrʌɡ/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (shrugged, shrugging)  to raise and then lower your shoulders in order to show that you do not know something or do not care about something<br>I just shrugged my shoulders and ignored him.<br>Melanie shrugged and walked away.</li></ul></blockquote><p>They are like that.

And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures…</p><p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no <u>resemblance</u> to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince’s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I <u>fumble</u> along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧sem‧blance /rɪˈzembləns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> if there is a resemblance between two people or things, they are similar, especially in the way they look → similarity<br>resemblance between<br>The resemblance between Susan and her sister was remarkable.<br>bear a (close/striking/uncanny etc) resemblance to somebody/something (=look like)<br>Tina bears a striking resemblance to her mother.<br>bear little/no resemblance to somebody/something<br>What happens in the film bears little resemblance to what actually happened.</li><li><strong>fum‧ble /ˈfʌmbəl/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (also fumble around) [intransitive, transitive] to try to hold, move, or find something with your hands in an awkward way<br>fumble at/in/with<br>She dressed, her cold fingers fumbling with the buttons.<br>fumble for<br>I fumbled around in my bag for a cigarette.<br>She reached round to fumble the light on.</li></ul></blockquote><p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.

The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the <u>catastrophe</u> of the <u>baobabs</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ca‧tas‧tro‧phe /kəˈtæstrəfi/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable, uncountable] a terrible event in which there is a lot of destruction, suffering, or death <strong>SYN:</strong> disaster<br>environmental/nuclear/economic etc catastrophe<br> The Black Sea is facing ecological catastrophe as a result of pollution.<br>prevent/avert a catastrophe<br> Sudan requires food immediately to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</li><li><strong>baobabs/‘beɪə(ʊ)bæb/:</strong> n.(非洲)猴面包树</li></ul></blockquote><p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it.

I am glad!”</p><p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:</p><p>“Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?”</p><p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole <u>herd</u> of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>herd /hɜːd $ hɜːrd/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable] a group of animals of one kind that live and feed together → flock<br>herd of<br>a herd of cattle<br>herds of elephants</li></ul></blockquote><p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p><p>“We would have to put them one on top of the other,” he said.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282007402033.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>But he made a wise comment:</p><p>“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.”</p><p>“That is strictly correct,” I said. “But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?”</p><p>He answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!”, as if he were speaking of something that was <u>self-evident.</u> And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any <u>assistance</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ˌself-ˈevident</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> clearly true and needing no more proof <strong>SYN:</strong> obvious<br>self-evident truths<br> it is self-evident (that)<br>It is self-evident that childhood experiences influence our adult behaviour.</li><li><strong>as‧sist‧ance /əˈsɪstəns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> help or support<br>We offer financial assistance to students.<br>Can I be of any assistance (=can I help you)?<br> with the assistance of somebody/something<br>We’ve rebuilt the theatre with the assistance of the National Lottery.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="5-2-小嫩苗"><a href="#5-2-小嫩苗" class="headerlink" title="5-2 小嫩苗"></a>5-2 小嫩苗</h3><p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived– as on all planets– good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth’s darkness, until some one among them <u>is seized with the desire to</u> awaken. Then this little seed will <u>stretch</u> itself and begin– <u>timidly</u> at first– to push a charming little <u>sprig</u> <u>inoffensively</u> upward toward the sun. If it is only a <u>sprout</u> of <u>radish</u> or the sprig of a <u>rose</u>-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>be seized with/by terror/desire etc</strong>:  to suddenly be affected by an extremely strong feeling<br>When she saw his face, she was seized by fear.</li><li><strong>stretch /stretʃ/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  BODY [intransitive, transitive] to straighten your arms, legs, or body to full length<br> Carl sat up in bed, yawned, and stretched.<br>  Always stretch before exercising.</li><li><strong>tim‧id /ˈtɪmɪd/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> not having courage or confidence <strong>SYN:</strong> shy <strong>OPP:</strong> confident<br> I was a timid child.<br>  a policy that is both timid and inadequate</li><li><strong>sprig /sprɪɡ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> a small stem or part of a branch with leaves or flowers on it<br> sprig of<br>  a sprig of parsley</li><li><strong>in‧of‧fen‧sive /ˌɪnəˈfensɪv◂/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> unlikely to offend or upset anyone<br> Her husband was a small, inoffensive-looking man.</li><li><strong>sprout /spraʊt/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  a new growth on a plant <strong>SYN:</strong> shoot</li><li><strong>rad‧ish /ˈrædɪʃ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> a small vegetable whose red or white root is eaten raw and has a strong spicy taste</li><li><strong>rose /rəʊz $ roʊz/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br> FLOWER [countable] a flower that often has a pleasant smell, and is usually red, pink, white, or yellow, or the bush that this flower grows on<br>  a dozen red roses<br>  A large bouquet of roses arrived on her desk.<br>  rose bushes</li></ul></blockquote><p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was <u>infested</u> with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It <u>spreads</u> over the entire planet. It <u>bores</u> clear through it with its roots.

You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they <u>resemble</u> so closely in their earliest <u>youth</u>.

That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,” he added, “there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.

He neglected three little bushes…”</p><p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a <u>moralist</u>. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my <u>reserve</u>. “Children,” I say <u>plainly</u>, “watch out for the baobabs!”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ought to /ˈɔːt tuː $ ˈɒːt-/</strong>:  <em>modal verb</em>  used to say that someone should do something because it is the best or most sensible thing to do <strong>SYN:</strong> should<br>You really ought to quit smoking.<br>The company ought to be making changes in its marketing strategy.<br>What sort of crimes ought the police to concentrate on?<br>You were out enjoying yourself when you ought to have been studying.</li><li><strong>mor‧al‧ist /ˈmɒrəlɪst $ ˈmɔː-/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  someone who has very strong beliefs about what is right and wrong and how people should behave – used to show disapproval<br>a narrow-minded moralist</li><li><strong>ca‧tas‧tro‧phe /kəˈtæstrəfi/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable, uncountable] a terrible event in which there is a lot of destruction, suffering, or death <strong>SYN:</strong> disaster<br>environmental/nuclear/economic etc catastrophe<br>The Black Sea is facing ecological catastrophe as a result of pollution.<br> prevent/avert a catastrophe<br>Sudan requires food immediately to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</li><li><strong>re‧serve /rɪˈzɜːv $ -ɜːrv/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  SUPPLY [countable usually plural] a supply of something kept to be used if it is needed<br>$10 million in cash reserves<br>oil reserves<br> reserve of<br>Somehow Debbie maintained an inner reserve of strength.</li><li><strong>plain‧ly /ˈpleɪnli/</strong>:  <em>adverb</em>  in a way that is easy to understand or recognize<br>Mrs Gorman was plainly delighted.<br>The first part of that argument is plainly true.<br>We could hear Tom’s voice plainly over the noise of the crowd.<br> [sentence adverb]<br>Plainly the laws are not effective.</li></ul></blockquote><p>My friends, like myself, have been <u>skirting</u> this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>skirt /skɜːt $ skɜːrt/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to avoid talking about an important subject, especially because it is difficult or embarrassing – used to show disapproval<br>a disappointing speech that skirted around all the main issues</li></ul></blockquote><p>Perhaps you will ask me, “Why are there no other drawing in this book as <u>magnificent</u> and <u>impressive</u> as this drawing of the baobabs?”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>mag‧nif‧i‧cent /mæɡˈnɪfəsənt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> very good or beautiful, and very impressive<br>a magnificent performance<br>The twelve-mile coastline has magnificent scenery.<br>She looked magnificent in a long red dress.</li><li><strong>im‧pres‧sive /ɪmˈpresɪv/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> something that is impressive makes you admire it because it is very good, large, important etc<br>The figures certainly look impressive.<br>Among the guests was an impressive array of authors and critics.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the <u>inspiring</u> force of <u>urgent</u> <u>necessity</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>in‧spir‧ing /ɪnˈspaɪərɪŋ $ -ˈspaɪr-/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> giving people a feeling of excitement and a desire to do something great <strong>OPP:</strong> uninspiring<br>inspiring music<br>King was a great orator and an inspiring leader.</li><li><strong>ur‧gent /ˈɜːdʒənt $ ˈɜːr-/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  very important and needing to be dealt with immediately<br> He was in urgent need of medical attention.<br>  The report called for urgent action to reduce lead in petrol.<br>  an urgent message</li><li><strong>ne‧ces‧si‧ty /nəˈsesəti/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  (plural necessities)   [countable] something that you need to have in order to live <strong>OPP:</strong> luxury<br> She saw books as a necessity, not a luxury.<br>  A car is an absolute necessity if you live in the country.<br> the basic/bare necessities<br>  A lot of families cannot even afford to buy the basic necessities of life.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-6"><a href="#Chapter-6" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 6"></a>Chapter 6</h2><p>- the little prince and the narrator talk about sunsets</p><h3 id="6-1-看日落"><a href="#6-1-看日落" class="headerlink" title="6-1 看日落"></a>6-1 看日落</h3><p>Oh, little prince! <u>Bit by bit</u> I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life… For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>bit by bit</strong>:  especially British English gradually<br>Bit by bit, I was starting to change my mind.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.”</p><p>“But we must wait,” I said.</p><p>“Wait? For what?”</p><p>“For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.”</p><p>At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:</p><p>“I am always thinking that I am at home!”</p><p>Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.</p><p>If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the <u>twilight</u> falling whenever you like…</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>twi‧light /ˈtwaɪlaɪt/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] the small amount of light in the sky as the day ends<br>in the twilight<br>The end of the cigarette glowed in the twilight.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“One day,” you said to me, “I saw the sunset forty-four times!”</p><p>And a little later you added:</p><p>“You know– one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…”</p><p>“Were you so sad, then?” I asked, “on the day of the forty-four sunsets?”</p><p>But the little prince made no reply.</p><h2 id="Chapter-7"><a href="#Chapter-7" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 7"></a>Chapter 7</h2><p>- the narrator learns about the secret of the little prince’s life</p><h3 id="7-1-螺丝的烦恼"><a href="#7-1-螺丝的烦恼" class="headerlink" title="7-1 螺丝的烦恼"></a>7-1 螺丝的烦恼</h3><p>On the fifth day– again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep– the secret of the little prince’s life was <u>revealed</u> to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent <u>meditation</u> on his problem, he <u>demanded</u>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧veal /rɪˈviːl/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to make known something that was previously secret or unknown <strong>OPP:</strong> conceal<br>He may be prosecuted for revealing secrets about the security agency.<br>a test that can reveal a teacher’s hidden skills<br> reveal (that)<br>He revealed that he had been in prison twice before.<br> reveal yourself (as/to be something)<br>The violinist revealed himself as a talented interpreter of classical music.</li><li><strong>med‧i‧ta‧tion /ˌmedɪˈteɪʃən/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable usually plural, uncountable] the act of thinking deeply and seriously about something<br>She found him sitting alone, deep in meditation.<br>Rob interrupted his father’s meditations.</li><li><strong>de‧mand /dɪˈmɑːnd $ dɪˈmænd/</strong>:  <em>verb</em><br>Angry demonstrators demanded the resignation of two senior officials.<br> demand to know/see/have etc something<br>I demand to know what’s going on.<br> demand that<br>They demanded that the military government free all political prisoners.<br> demand something of somebody<br>It seemed that no matter what she did, more was demanded of her.<br>‘Where are you going?’ she demanded angrily.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“A sheep– if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?”</p><p>“A sheep,” I answered, “eats anything it finds in its <u>reach</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>reach /riːtʃ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [singular, uncountable] the distance that you can stretch out your arm to touch something<br>out of/beyond (somebody’s) reach<br>Keep chemicals out of the reach of children.<br>within reach (of somebody)<br>Keep a glass of water within reach.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Even flowers that have <u>thorns</u>?”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>thorn /θɔːn $ θɔːrn/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable] a sharp point that grows on the stem of a plant such as a rose </li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yes, even flowers that have thorns.”</p><p>“Then the thorns– what use are they?”</p><p>I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to <u>unscrew</u> a <u>bolt</u> that had <u>got stuck in</u> my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>un‧screw /ʌnˈskruː/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to take the screws out of something </li><li><strong>bolt /bəʊlt $ boʊlt/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>SCREW a screw with a flat head and no point, for fastening things together</li><li><strong>stuck /stʌk/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  impossible or unable to move from a particular position<br>Sara tried to open the window but it was stuck.<br> They got stuck in a traffic jam.<br>stuck in<br> The boat was stuck in the mud.<br> I’ve got something stuck in my throat.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“The thorns– what use are they?”</p><p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:</p><p>“The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for <u>spite</u>!”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>spite /spaɪt/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a feeling of wanting to hurt or upset people, for example because you are jealous or think you have been unfairly treated<br>out of spite (=because of spite)<br>She broke it just out of spite.<br>pure/sheer spite (=spite and nothing else)</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Oh!”</p><p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧sent‧ful /rɪˈzentfəl/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> feeling angry and upset about something that you think is unfair <strong>SYN:</strong> bitter<br>resentful of/about/at etc<br>She felt resentful at not being promoted.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I don’t believe you!

At that instant I was saying to myself: “If this bolt still won’t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.” Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ham‧mer /ˈhæmə $ -ər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>TOOL<br>a) a tool with a heavy metal part on a long handle, used for hitting nails into wood<br>b) a tool like this with a wooden head used to make something flat, make a noise etc<br>an auctioneer’s hammer</li></ul></blockquote><p>“And you actually believe that the flowers–”</p><p>“Oh, no!” I cried. “No, no no! I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don’t you see– I am very busy with matters of consequence!”</p><h3 id="7-2-蘑菇人"><a href="#7-2-蘑菇人" class="headerlink" title="7-2 蘑菇人"></a>7-2 蘑菇人</h3><p>He stared at me, <u>thunderstruck</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>thun‧der‧struck /ˈθʌndəstrʌk $ -ər-/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> extremely surprised or shocked<br>Jeff looked thunderstruck when he saw me.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Matters of consequence!”</p><p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-<u>grease</u>, <u>bending down</u> over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly…</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>grease /ɡriːs/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a thick oily substance that is put on the moving parts of a car, machine etc to make it run or move smoothly</li><li><strong>bend /bend/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (past tense and past participle bent /bent/)   [intransitive, transitive] to move part of your body so that it is not straight or so that you are not upright<br> Lee bent and kissed her.<br>  She bent her head.<br>  Bend your knees, but keep your back straight.<br> bend over<br>  Emma bent over to pick up the coins.<br> bend down<br>  I bent down to lift the box off the floor.<br> bend towards/across etc<br>  He bent towards me and whispered in my ear.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“You talk just like the grown-ups!”</p><p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, <u>relentlessly</u>:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧lent‧less /rɪˈlentləs/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  strict, cruel, or determined, without ever stopping<br>her relentless determination to succeed<br>a regime that was relentless in its persecution of dissidents</li></ul></blockquote><p>“You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…”</p><p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p><p>“I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of consequence!’ And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man– he is a mushroom!”</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>“A mushroom!”</p><p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282107402033.jpg" alt="童话小说《小王子》 "></p><p>“The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I know– I, myself– one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing– Oh! You think that is not important!”</p><h3 id="7-3-独一无二的一株花"><a href="#7-3-独一无二的一株花" class="headerlink" title="7-3 独一无二的一株花"></a>7-3 独一无二的一株花</h3><p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p><p>“If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there…’ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened… And you think that is not important!”</p><p>He could not say anything more. His words were <u>choked</u> by <u>sobbing</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>choked /tʃəʊkt $ tʃoʊkt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> British English very upset<br>I was really choked when I heard he’d died.</li><li><strong>sob /sɒb $ sɑːb/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (sobbed, sobbing)<br>He began sobbing uncontrollably.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:</p><p>“The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a <u>muzzle</u> for your sheep. I will draw you a <u>railing</u> to put around your flower. I will–”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>muz‧zle /ˈmʌzəl/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a cover that you put over a dog’s mouth to stop it from biting people </li><li><strong>rail‧ing /ˈreɪlɪŋ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  (also railings [plural]) a metal fence that is made of a series of upright bars<br>a small park surrounded by railings</li></ul></blockquote><p>I did not know what to say to him. I felt <u>awkward</u> and <u>blundering</u>. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>awk‧ward /ˈɔːkwəd $ ˈɒːkwərd/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  making you feel embarrassed so that you are not sure what to do or say <strong>SYN:</strong> difficult<br>I hoped he would stop asking awkward questions.<br>There was an awkward moment when she didn’t know whether to shake his hand or kiss his cheek.<br>an awkward silence<br>A laugh can help people over an awkward situation.<br>Philip’s remarks put her in an awkward position (=made it difficult for her to know what to do).</li><li><strong>blun‧der‧ing /ˈblʌndərɪŋ/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> careless or stupid<br> You blundering idiot!</li></ul></blockquote><p>It is such a secret place, the land of tears.</p><h2 id="Chapter-8"><a href="#Chapter-8" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 8"></a>Chapter 8</h2><p>- the rose arrives at the little prince’s planet</p><h3 id="8-1-花苞中的奇迹"><a href="#8-1-花苞中的奇迹" class="headerlink" title="8-1 花苞中的奇迹"></a>8-1 花苞中的奇迹</h3><p>I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince’s planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p><p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge <u>bud</u>, felt at once that some sort of <u>miraculous</u> apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green <u>chamber</u>. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her <u>petals</u> one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all <u>rumpled</u>, like the field <u>poppies</u>. It was only in the full <u>radiance</u> of her beauty that she wished to appear. </p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>bud /bʌd/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a young tightly rolled-up flower or leaf before it opens<br>rose buds<br>in bud (=having buds but no flowers yet)<br>come into bud (=start to produce buds)</li><li><strong>mi‧rac‧u‧lous /mɪˈrækjələs/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  very good, completely unexpected, and often very lucky<br>She made a miraculous recovery from her injuries.<br>They had a miraculous escape when their car plunged into a river.</li><li><strong>ap‧pa‧ri‧tion /ˌæpəˈrɪʃən/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> something that you imagine you can see, especially the spirit of a dead person<br>He stared at the strange apparition before him.<br>a ghostly apparition of a man</li><li><strong>cham‧ber /ˈtʃeɪmbə $ -ər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  ENCLOSED SPACE [countable] an enclosed space, especially in your body or inside a machine<br>a combustion chamber<br>The heart has four chambers.</li><li><strong>pet‧al /ˈpetl/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> one of the coloured parts of a flower that are shaped like leaves<br>rose petals<br>The flower has seven petals.</li><li><strong>rum‧ple /ˈrʌmpəl/</strong>:  <em>verb</em> to make hair, clothes etc less tidy<br>He rumpled her hair playfully.</li><li><strong>pop‧py /ˈpɒpi $ -ˈpɑː-/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  (plural poppies)  a plant that has brightly coloured, usually red, flowers and small black seeds</li><li><strong>ra‧di‧ance /ˈreɪdiəns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  great happiness that shows in someone’s face and makes them look attractive<br> a young face full of radiance</li></ul></blockquote><p>Oh, yes!

I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me. My petals are still all disarranged…”</p><p>But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:</p><p>“Oh! How beautiful you are!”</p><p>“Am I not?” the flower responded, sweetly. “And I was born at the same moment as the sun…”</p><p>The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest– but how moving– and exciting– she was!</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282407402033.jpg" alt="小王子和玫瑰"></p><p>“I think it is time for breakfast,” she added an instant later. “If you would have the kindness to think of my needs–”</p><p>And the little prince, completely <u>abashed</u>, went to look for a <u>sprinkling</u>-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>a‧bashed /əˈbæʃt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> embarrassed or ashamed because you have done something wrong or stupid <strong>SYN:</strong> shamefaced<br>She looked rather abashed.</li><li><strong>sprin‧kling /ˈsprɪŋklɪŋ/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> a small amount of something, especially scattered over an area<br>sprinkling of<br>The hilltops were covered with a sprinkling of snow.</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282607402033.jpg" alt="小王子和玫瑰"></p><p>So, too, she began very quickly to <u>torment</u> him with her <u>vanity</u>– which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with.

And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.”</p><p>“Why is that?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Because <u>intoxicated</u> men see double.

Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.”</p><p>“One goes to see it?”</p><p>“No. That would be too complicated.

For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.”</p><p>The geographer was suddenly <u>stirred</u> to <u>excitement</u>.</p><p>“But you– you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!”</p><p>And, having opened his big <u>register</u>, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The <u>recitals</u> of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.</p><p>“Well?” said the geographer <u>expectantly</u>.</p><p>“Oh, where I live,” said the little prince, “it is not very interesting. It is all so small.“</p><h3 id="15-3-什么叫短暂"><a href="#15-3-什么叫短暂" class="headerlink" title="15-3 什么叫短暂"></a>15-3 什么叫短暂</h3><p>” I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.”</p><p>“One never knows,” said the geographer.</p><p>“I have also a flower.”</p><p>“We do not record flowers,” said the geographer.</p><p>“Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!”</p><p>“We do not record them,” said the geographer, “because they are <u>ephemeral</u>.”</p><p>“What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p><p>“Geographies,” said the geographer, “are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean <u>empties</u> itself of its waters. We write of <u>eternal</u> things.”</p><p>“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,” the little prince interrupted. “What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p><p>“Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,” said the geographer. “The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.”</p><p>“But what does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.</p><p>“It means, ‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.’”</p><p>“Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?”</p><p>“Certainly it is.”</p><p>“My flower is ephemeral,” the little prince said to himself, “and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!”</p><p>That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.</p><p>“What place would you advise me to visit now?” he asked.</p><p>“The planet Earth,” replied the geographer. “It has a good reputation.”</p><p>And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.</p><h2 id="Chapter-16"><a href="#Chapter-16" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 16"></a>Chapter 16</h2><p>- the narrator discusses the Earth’s lamplighters</p><h3 id="16-1地球上的国王"><a href="#16-1地球上的国王" class="headerlink" title="16-1地球上的国王"></a>16-1地球上的国王</h3><p>So then the seventh planet was the Earth.</p><p>The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the <u>Negro</u> kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men– that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</p><p>To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a <u>veritable</u> army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.</p><p>Seen from a slight distance, that would make a <u>splendid</u> <u>spectacle</u>. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and <u>Siberia</u> would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the <u>wings</u>. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.</p><p>Only the man who was <u>in charge of</u> the single lamp at the North Pole, and his <u>colleague</u> who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole– only these two would live free from <u>toil</u> and care: they would be busy twice a year.</p><h2 id="Chapter-17"><a href="#Chapter-17" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 17"></a>Chapter 17</h2><p>- the little prince makes the acquaintance of the snake</p><h3 id="17-1-人类的位置"><a href="#17-1-人类的位置" class="headerlink" title="17-1 人类的位置"></a>17-1 人类的位置</h3><p>When one wishes to play the <u>wit</u>, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not k now it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be <u>piled up</u> on a small <u>Pacific</u> <u>islet</u>.</p><p>The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They <u>imagine</u> that they fill a great deal of space. They <u>fancy</u> themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore fig ures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary.

But how far away it is!”</p><p>“It is beautiful,” the snake said. “What has brought you here?”</p><p>“I have been having some trouble with a flower,” said the little prince.</p><p>“Ah!” said the snake.</p><p>And they were both silent.</p><p>“Where are the men?” the little prince at last took up the conversation again. “It is a little lonely in the desert…”</p><p>“It is also lonely among men,” the snake said.</p><p>The little prince gazed at him for a long time.</p><p>“You are a funny animal,” he said at last. “You are no <u>thicker</u> than a finger…”</p><p>“But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,” said the snake.</p><p>The little prince smiled.</p><p>“You are not very powerful.

His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe.

Please excuse me,” said the little prince.</p><p>But, after some thought, he added:</p><p>“What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“You do not live here,” said the fox. “What is it that you are looking for?”</p><p>“I am looking for men,” said the little prince. “What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“Men,” said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?”</p><p>“No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. It means to establish ties.”</p><p>“‘To establish ties’?”</p><p>“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…”</p><p>“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…”</p><p>“It is possible,” said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.”</p><h3 id="21-2-驯服一只狐狸"><a href="#21-2-驯服一只狐狸" class="headerlink" title="21-2 驯服一只狐狸"></a>21-2 驯服一只狐狸</h3><p>“Oh, but this is not on the Earth!” said the little prince.</p><p>The fox seemed <u>perplexed</u>, and very curious.</p><p>“On another planet?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are there hunters on this planet?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283907402038.jpg" alt="《小王子》中的猎人"></p><p>But he came back to his idea.</p><p>“My life is very <u>monotonous</u>,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life . I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my <u>burrow</u>. And then look: you see the grain-fields down <u>yonder</u>? I do not ea t bread. <u>Wheat</u> is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me bac k the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…”</p><p>The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p><p>“Please– tame me!” he said.</p><p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p><p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…”</p><p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me– like that– in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day…”</p><h3 id="21-3-特殊的仪式"><a href="#21-3-特殊的仪式" class="headerlink" title="21-3 特殊的仪式"></a>21-3 特殊的仪式</h3><p>The next day the little prince came back.</p><p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you… One must observe the <u>proper</u> <u>rites</u>…”</p><p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the <u>vineyards</u>. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”</p><p>So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure <u>drew</u> near–</p><p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p><p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…”</p><p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p><p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p><p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p><p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p><p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the color of the wheat fields.” And then he added:</p><p>“Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”</p><p>The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p><h3 id="21-4-我的玫瑰花"><a href="#21-4-我的玫瑰花" class="headerlink" title="21-4 我的玫瑰花"></a>21-4 我的玫瑰花</h3><p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.”</p><p>And the roses were very much embarrassed.</p><p>“You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you– the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284107402039.jpg" alt="小说《小王子》的狐狸"></p><p>And he went back to meet the fox.</p><p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p><p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”</p><p>“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><p>“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”</p><p>“It is the time I have wasted for my rose–” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose…”</p><p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><h2 id="Chapter-22"><a href="#Chapter-22" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 22"></a>Chapter 22</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a railway switchman</p><p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p><p>“Good morning,” said the railway switchman.</p><p>“What do you do here?” the little prince asked.</p><p>“I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,” said the switchman. “I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left.”</p><p>And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman’s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.</p><p>“They are in a great hurry,” said the little prince. “What are they looking for?”</p><p>“Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,” said the switchman.</p><p>And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Are they coming back already?” demanded the little prince.</p><p>“These are not the same ones,” said the switchman. “It is an exchange.”</p><p>“Were they not satisfied where they were?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“No one is ever satisfied where he is,” said the switchman.</p><p>And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.</p><p>“Are they pursuing the first travelers?” demanded the little prince.</p><p>“They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.”</p><p>“Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry…”</p><p>“They are lucky,” the switchman said.</p><h2 id="Chapter-23"><a href="#Chapter-23" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 23"></a>Chapter 23</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a merchant</p><p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p><p>“Good morning,” said the merchant.</p><p>This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.</p><p>“Why are you selling those?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Because they save a tremendous amount of time,” said the merchant. “Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.”</p><p>“And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?”</p><p>“Anything you like…”</p><p>“As for me,” said the little prince to himself, “if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.”</p><h2 id="Chapter-24"><a href="#Chapter-24" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 24"></a>Chapter 24</h2><p>- the narrator and the little prince, thirsty, hunt for a well in the desert</p><p>It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.</p><p>“Ah,” I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!”</p><p>“My friend the fox–” the little prince said to me.</p><p>“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I am about to die of thirst…”</p><p>He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:</p><p>“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend…”</p><p>“He has no way of guessing the danger,” I said to myself. “He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs…”</p><p>But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:</p><p>“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well…”</p><p>I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.</p><p>When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory:</p><p>“Then you are thirsty, too?” I demanded.</p><p>But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:</p><p>“Water may also be good for the heart…”</p><p>I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.</p><p>He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:</p><p>“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.”</p><p>I replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.</p><p>“The desert is beautiful,” the little prince added.</p><p>And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams…</p><p>“What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well…”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284307402039.jpg" alt="使沙漠更加美丽的，就是在某个角落里，藏着一口井"></p><p>I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart…</p><p>“Yes,” I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the desert– what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!”</p><p>“I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my fox.”</p><p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…”</p><p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower– the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…” And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…</p><p>And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</p><h2 id="Chapter-25"><a href="#Chapter-25" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 25"></a>Chapter 25</h2><p>- finding a well, the narrator and the little prince discuss his return to his planet</p><p>“Men,” said the little prince, “set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round…”</p><p>And he added:</p><p>“It is not worth the trouble…”</p><p>The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming…</p><p>“It is strange,” I said to the little prince. “Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope…”</p><p>He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284607402039.jpg" alt="《小王子》的水井"></p><p>“Do you hear?” said the little prince. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing…”</p><p>I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.</p><p>“Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.”</p><p>I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there– happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.</p><p>“I am thirsty for this water,” said the little prince. “Give me some of it to drink…”</p><p>And I understood what he had been looking for.</p><p>I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.</p><p>“The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden– and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”</p><p>“They do not find it,” I replied.</p><p>“And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”</p><p>“Yes, that is true,” I said.</p><p>And the little prince added:</p><p>“But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…”</p><p>I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?</p><p>“You must keep your promise,” said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.</p><p>“What promise?”</p><p>“You know– a muzzle for my sheep… I am responsible for this flower…”</p><p>I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:</p><p>“Your baobabs– they look a little like cabbages.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>I had been so proud of my baobabs!</p><p>“Your fox– his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“You are not fair, little prince,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.”</p><p>“Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.”</p><p>So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.</p><p>“You have plans that I do not know about,” I said.</p><p>But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:</p><p>“You know– my descent to the earth… Tomorrow will be its anniversary.”</p><p>Then, after a silence, he went on:</p><p>“I came down very near here.”</p><p>And he flushed.</p><p>And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:</p><p>“Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you– a week ago– you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?”</p><p>The little prince flushed again.</p><p>And I added, with some hesitancy:</p><p>“Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?”</p><p>The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions– but when one flushes does that not mean “Yes”?</p><p>“Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened–”</p><p>But he interrupted me.</p><p>“Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening…”</p><p>But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed…</p><h2 id="Chapter-26"><a href="#Chapter-26" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 26"></a>Chapter 26</h2><p>- the little prince converses with the snake; the little prince consoles the narrator; the little prince returns to his planet</p><p>Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:</p><p>“Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.”</p><p>Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:</p><p>“Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.”</p><p>I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:</p><p>“–Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284807402040.jpg" alt="小王子和蛇"></p><p>I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.</p><p>After a silence the little prince spoke again:</p><p>“You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?”</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.</p><p>“Now go away,” said the little prince. “I want to get down from the wall.”</p><p>I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall– and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.</p><p>I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.</p><p>“What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talking with snakes?”</p><p>I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone’s rifle…</p><p>“I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go back home–”</p><p>“How do you know about that?”</p><p>I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.</p><p>He made no answer to my question, but he added:</p><p>“I, too, am going back home today…”</p><p>Then, sadly–</p><p>“It is much farther… it is much more difficult…”</p><p>I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him…</p><p>His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.</p><p>“I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle…”</p><p>And he gave me a sad smile.</p><p>I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.</p><p>“Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid…”</p><p>He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.</p><p>“I shall be much more afraid this evening…”</p><p>Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.</p><p>“Little man,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.”</p><p>But he said to me:</p><p>“Tonight, it will be a year… my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago…”</p><p>“Little man,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream– this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star…”</p><p>But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen…”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers…”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember– how good it was.”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens… they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present…”</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>“Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!”</p><p>“That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water…”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems . For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You– you alone– will have the stars as no one else has them–”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… you– only you– will have stars that can laugh!”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure… and your friends w ill be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you…”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh…”</p><p>And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:</p><p>“Tonight– you know… do not come,” said the little prince.</p><p>“I shall not leave you,” I said.</p><p>“I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble…”</p><p>“I shall not leave you.”</p><p>But he was worried.</p><p>“I tell you– it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes– they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun…”</p><p>“I shall not leave you.”</p><p>But a thought came to reassure him:</p><p>“It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284907402040.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:</p><p>“Ah! You are there…”</p><p>And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.</p><p>“It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“You understand… it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:</p><p>“You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water…”</p><p>And he too said nothing more, because he was crying…</p><p>“Here it is. Let me go on by myself.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285007402040.jpg" alt="他这时坐下来，因为他害怕了。"></p><p>And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:</p><p>“You know– my flower… I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so nae! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world…”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285107402040.jpg" alt="他轻轻地象一棵树一样倒在地上，大概由于沙地的缘故，连一点响声都没有。"></p><p>I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.</p><p>“There now– that is all…”</p><p>He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.</p><p>There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.</p><h2 id="Chapter-27"><a href="#Chapter-27" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 27"></a>Chapter 27</h2><p>- the narrator’s afterthoughts</p><p>And now six years have already gone by…</p><p>I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I am tired.”</p><p>Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say– not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body… and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells…</p><p>But there is one extraordinary thing… when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower…</p><p>At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully…” Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.</p><p>But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night…” And then the little bells are changed to tears…</p><p>Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has– yes or no?– eaten a rose…</p><p>Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes…</p><p>And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285207402041.jpg" alt="在我看来，这是世界上最美、也最凄凉的景色。"></p><p>This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</p><p>Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back……</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-5-DIAGON-ALLEY"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-5-DIAGON-ALLEY" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY"></a>Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY</h1><p>Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.</p><p>“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”</p><p>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</p><p>And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”</p><p>He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The <u>hut</u> was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.</p><blockquote><ul><li>hut /hʌt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, simple building, usually consisting of one room:<br>a mountain hut<br>a row of beach huts</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large <u>balloon</u> was <u>swelling</u> inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.</p><blockquote><ul><li>balloon /bəˈluːn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, very thin rubber bag that you blow air into or fill with a light gas until it is round in shape, used for decoration at parties or as a children’s toy:<br>We tied balloons and streamers to the ceiling ready for the party.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/balloo_noun_001_01102.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of balloon"></p><ul><li>swelling /ˈswel.ɪŋ/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a part of your body that has become bigger because of illness or injury:<br>Put your foot into cold water to help the swelling go down.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Don’t do that.”</p><p>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.</p><p>“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</p><p>“What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, <u>peppermint</u> <u>humbugs</u>, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.</p><p>“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.</p><blockquote><ul><li>peppermint /ˈpep.ɚ.mɪnt/: <em>noun</em> a strong fresh flavoring from a type of mint plant, used especially to give flavor to candy:<br>She drinks peppermint-flavored tea.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/pepper_noun_002_27131.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of peppermint"></p><ul><li>humbug /ˈhʌm.bʌɡ/: <em>noun (SWEET)</em> a hard sweet, usually with a mint taste and strips of two different colors on the outside:<br>mint humbugs</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/humbug_noun_002_18402.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of humbug"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>魔法世界的钱币叫Knuts</p></blockquote><p>“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.”</p><p>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small <u>leather</u> pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.</p><blockquote><ul><li>leather /ˈleð.ɚ/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> animal skin treated in order to preserve it, and used to make shoes, bags, clothes, equipment, etc.:<br>a leather coat/belt/purse</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</p><p>“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”</p><p>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.</p><p>“Um — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.</p><p>“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”</p><p>“But if their house was destroyed —”</p><p>“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”</p><blockquote><p>海格要带哈利去古灵阁Gringotts 取父母留给哈利的遗产。</p></blockquote><p>“Wizards have banks?”</p><p>“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by <u>goblins</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>goblin /ˈɡɑː.blɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> (in stories) a small, ugly creature that is harmful to humans</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</p><p>“Goblins?”</p><p>“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.</p><p>“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”</p><p>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea <u>gleamed</u> in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.</p><p>“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gleam /ɡliːm/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to produce or reflect a small, bright light:<br>He polished the table until it gleamed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Flew,” said Hagrid.</p><p>“Flew?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”</p><p>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.</p><p>“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.</p><p>“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Spells — <u>enchantments</u>,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security <u>vaults</u>. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>enchantment /ɪnˈtʃænt.mənt/: <em>noun (PLEASURE)</em> a feeling of great pleasure and attraction, especially because something is very beautiful:<br>The audience looked on in utter fascination and enchantment.<br>This is a place of enchantment and beauty.</li><li>vault /vɑːlt/: <em>noun (ARCH)</em> a type of arch that supports a roof or ceiling, especially in a church or public building, or a ceiling or roof supported by several of these arches</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/vault_noun_002_39917.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of vault"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>古灵阁在伦敦地下几百英里深的地方，重要的宝库被龙把守。</p></blockquote><p>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.</p><p>“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.</p><p>“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.</p><p>“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one.

Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”</p><p>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the <u>harbor</u> wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they <u>clambered</u> up the stone steps onto the street.</p><blockquote><ul><li>harbor /ˈhɑːr.bɚ/: <em>verb (HAVE IN MIND)</em> an area of water next to the coast, often protected from the ocean by a thick wall, where ships and boats can shelter:<br>Our hotel room overlooked a pretty little fishing harbor.</li><li>clamber /ˈklæm.bɚ/: <em>verb [ I usually + adv/prep ]</em> to climb up, across, or into somewhere with difficulty, using the hands and the feet:<br>They clambered over/up the rocks.<br>I clambered into/onto the bus.<br>She clambered into bed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t <u>blame</u> them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”</p><blockquote><ul><li>blame /bleɪm/: <em>verb [ T ]</em> to say or think that someone or something did something wrong or is responsible for something bad happening:<br>Don’t blame me (= it is not my fault) if you miss the bus!<br>Hugh blames his mother for his lack of confidence.<br>Hugh blames his lack of confidence on his mother.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”</p><p>“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”</p><p>“You’d like one?”</p><p>“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”</p><blockquote><p>海格从小的时候就想要养一只龙。</p></blockquote><p>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.</p><p>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a <u>canary</u>-yellow <u>circus</u> tent.</p><blockquote><ul><li>canary /kəˈner.i/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, yellow bird that is well

aloud.</p><p>“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.</p><p>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.</p><p>“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down <u>escalator</u> that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.</p><blockquote><ul><li>escalator /ˈes.kə.leɪ.t̬ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a set of stairs moved up or down by electric power on which people can stand and be taken from one level of a building to another, especially in stores, railroad stations, and airports:<br>I’ll meet you by the up/down escalator on the second floor.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/escala_noun_002_12711.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of escalator"></p></blockquote><p>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and <u>broomsticks</u>? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.</p><blockquote><ul><li>broomstick /ˈbruːm.stɪk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a broom made of sticks:<br>In children’s books, witches are often shown riding broomsticks.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brooms_noun_002_04678.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of broomstick"></p></blockquote><p>“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”</p><p>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.</p><blockquote><p>海格带着哈利来到 “破釜酒吧”(the Leaky Cauldron) 。只有会魔法的人可以看到它。</p></blockquote><p>For a famous place, it was very dark and <u>shabby</u>. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of <u>sherry</u>. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old <u>bartender</u>, who was quite <u>bald</u> and looked like a toothless <u>walnut</u>. The low <u>buzz</u> of <u>chatter</u> stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”</p><blockquote><ul><li>shabby /ˈʃæb.i/: <em>adjective (BAD CONDITION)</em> looking old and in bad condition because of being used for a long time or not being cared for:<br>He wore a shabby old overcoat.<br>Her home is a rented one-bedroom apartment in a shabby part of town.<br>The refugees were shabby (= wore old clothes in bad condition) and hungry.</li><li>sherry /ˈʃer.i/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a type of strong wine from southern Spain that is a pale yellow or brown color, sometimes drunk before a meal:<br>sweet/dry sherry<br>Would you like a glass of sherry/some sherry?<br>Would you like a sherry (= a glass of sherry)?</li><li>bartender /ˈbɑːrˌten.dɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> someone who makes and serves drinks in a bar</li><li>bald /bɑːld/: <em>adjective (NO HAIR)</em> with little or no hair on the head:<br>At 20 he was already going bald.</li><li>walnut /ˈwɑːl.nʌt/: <em>noun</em> a nut with a slightly bitter taste, a series of folds in it, and a hard shell:<br>Sprinkle with chopped walnuts to serve.<br>a pear and walnut salad<br>walnut cookies</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/walnut_noun_002_40493.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of walnut"></p><ul><li>buzz /bʌz/: <em>verb (MAKE SOUND)</em> to make a continuous, low sound such as the one a bee makes:<br>I can hear something buzzing.</li><li>chatter /ˈtʃæt̬.ɚ/: <em>verb (TALK/NOISE)</em> to talk for a long time about things that are not important:<br>She spent the morning chattering away to her friends.<br>He chattered happily about nothing in particular.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees <u>buckle</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>buckle /ˈbʌk.əl/: verb (FASTEN) to fasten or be fastened with a buckle</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this can this be — ?”</p><p>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.</p><p>“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . what an honor.”</p><p>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</p><p>“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was <u>puffing</u> on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.</p><blockquote><ul><li>puff /pʌf/: <em>verb (BREATHE)</em> to breathe fast and with difficulty, usually because you have been exercising:<br>He came puffing up the stairs.<br>[ + speech ] “I ran all the way home,” she puffed (= said while puffing).</li></ul></blockquote><p>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”</p><p>“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”</p><p>“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a <u>flutter</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>flutter /ˈflʌt̬.ɚ/: <em>verb (MOVE)</em> to make a series of quick delicate movements up and down or from side to side, or to cause something to do this:<br>Brightly colored flags were fluttering in the breeze.<br>Leaves fluttered down onto the path.<br>Butterflies fluttered about in the sunshine.<br>A white bird poised on a wire and fluttered its wings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.”</p><p>“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”</p><p>“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”</p><p>Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.</p><p>A <u>pale</u> young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was <u>twitching</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>pale /peɪl/: <em>adjective</em> used to describe a person’s face or skin if it has less color than usual, for example when the person is or sick or frightened, or if it has less color than people generally have:<br>You’re looking pale - are you feeling well?<br>She has a naturally pale complexion and dark hair.</li><li>twitch /twɪtʃ/: <em>verb (MOVE SLIGHTLY)</em> (to cause) to make a sudden small movement with a part of the body, usually without intending to:<br>He tried to suppress a smile but felt the corner of his mouth twitch.<br>She twitched her nose like a rabbit.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”</p><blockquote><p>奇洛教授（Quirrell）出现。黑魔法防御术的老师。</p></blockquote><p>“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”</p><p>“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”</p><p>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on <u>vampires</u>, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.</p><blockquote><ul><li>vampire /ˈvæm.paɪr/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> (in stories) a dead person who comes back to life and sucks blood from other people at night:<br>The most famous vampire is Count Dracula of Transylvania.</li></ul></blockquote><p>But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the <u>babble</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>babble /ˈbæb.əl/: <em>verb (TALK)</em> to talk or say something in a quick, confused, excited, or silly way:<br>The children babbled excitedly among themselves.<br>She was babbling something about her ring being stolen.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”</p><p>Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.</p><p>Hagrid <u>grinned</u> at Harry.</p><blockquote><ul><li>grin /ɡrɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a wide smile:<br>I assumed things had gone well for him because he had a big grin on his face.<br>a broad/sheepish grin</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/grin_noun_002_16558.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of grin"></p></blockquote><p>“Told yeh, didn’t I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin’ ter meet yeh — mind you, he’s usually tremblin’.”</p><p>“Is he always that nervous?”</p><p>“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since. Scared of the students, scared of his own subject now, where’s me umbrella?”</p><blockquote><p>奇洛教授在哈利第一年结束前担任黑魔法防御术课教授。他因自己的才气而出名，他的理论知识非常扎实，但他希望能得到第一手的实践经验。因此，在1991—1992学年段，奇洛抽出一部分时间去积累黑魔法防御术的实践经验。<br>他旅行到了黑暗森林，在那里陷入了麻烦，他遇到了几个吸血鬼和女巫。结果，当他返回学校继续教自己的课程的时候，他开始害怕所有东西，包括他的学生。他开始变的结巴，他的懦弱和无助曝露无疑。<br>事实上，他在旅行到阿尔巴尼亚时遇到了伏地魔，那时候的伏地魔无疑是寄居在一些小的啮齿动物动物的身上。这确实出乎奇洛意料，他被劝说成为黑暗势力的一员，成了伏地魔的仆人。</p></blockquote><p>Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</p><p>“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”</p><p>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.</p><p>The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</p><p>“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”</p><blockquote><p>海格用伞敲击垃圾箱上的砖块，打开了通向对角巷的路。</p></blockquote><p>He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.</p><blockquote><ul><li>archway /ˈɑːrtʃ.weɪ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> an entrance or passage formed by an arch</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/archwa_noun_002_01520.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of archway"></p></blockquote><p>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.</p><p>“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”</p><p>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.</p><p>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with <u>broomsticks</u> in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . .</p><blockquote><ul><li>broomstick /ˈbruːm.stɪk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a broom made of sticks:<br>In children’s books, witches are often shown riding broomsticks.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brooms_noun_002_04678.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of broomstick"></p></blockquote><p>“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.</p><p>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its <u>burnished</u> <u>bronze</u> doors, wearing a uniform of <u>scarlet</u> and gold, was —</p><blockquote><ul><li>burnished /ˈbɝː.nɪʃt/: <em>adjective</em> smooth and shiny, usually because of being polished (= rubbed):<br>The case is burnished aluminum.<br>burnished mahogany doors</li><li>bronze /brɑːnz/: <em>noun</em> a brown metal made of copper and tin:<br>The church bells are made of bronze.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/bronze_noun_002_04664.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of bronze"></p><ul><li>scarlet /ˈskɑːr.lət/: <em>noun [ U ], adjective</em> bright red:<br>scarlet berries<br>He went scarlet with shame.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a <u>swarthy</u>, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, <u>silver</u> this time, with words <u>engraved</u> upon them:</p><blockquote><ul><li>swarthy /ˈswɔːr.ði/: <em>adjective</em> (of a person or their skin) dark:<br>a swarthy face/complexion<br>a swarthy fisherman</li><li>silver /ˈsɪl.vɚ/: <em>noun (METAL)</em> a chemical element that is a valuable shiny, white metal, used for making silverware (= knives, spoons, etc.), jewelry, coins, and decorative objects:<br>We gave them a dish made of solid silver as a wedding present.<br>Cleaning the silver (= silver objects) is a dirty job.<br>Should we use the silver (= knives, spoons, plates, etc. made of silver) for dinner tonight?<br>UK I need some silver (= coins made of silver or a metal of similar appearance) for the ticket machine in the car park.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/silver_noun_002_33834.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of silver"></p><ul><li>engrave /ɪnˈɡreɪv/: <em>verb [ T ]</em> to cut words, pictures, or patterns into the surface of metal, stone, etc.:<br>The jeweler skillfully engraved the initials on the ring.<br>The bracelet was engraved with his name and date of birth.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours,</p><p>Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.</p><p>“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.</p><p>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast <u>marble</u> hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high <u>stools</u> behind a long counter, <u>scribbling</u> in large <u>ledgers</u>, weighing coins in <u>brass</u> scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.</p><blockquote><ul><li>marble /ˈmɑːr.bəl/: <em>noun (ROCK)</em> a type of very hard rock that has a pattern of lines going through it, feels cold, and can be polished to become smooth and shiny:<br>a marble floor/statue</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marble_noun_002_22381.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of marble"></p><ul><li>stool /stuːl/: <em>noun (SEAT)</em> a seat without any support for the back or arms:<br>a bar/kitchen/piano stool<br>a three-legged stool</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stool_noun_002_36042.jpg?version=5.0.180" alt="picture of stool"></p><ul><li>scribble /ˈskrɪb.əl/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to write or draw something quickly or carelessly:<br>The baby’s just scribbled all over my new dictionary!<br>[ + two objects ] I’ll just scribble Dad a note/scribble a note to Dad to say we’re going out.</li><li>ledger /ˈledʒ.ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a book in which things are regularly recorded, especially business activities and money received or paid</li><li>brass /bræs/: <em>noun (METAL)</em> a bright yellow metal made from copper and zinc:<br>The door handles were made of brass.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brass_noun_002_04427.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of brass"></p></blockquote><p>“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”</p><p>“You have his key, sir?”</p><p>“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of <u>moldy</u> dog <u>biscuits</u> over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.</p><blockquote><ul><li>moldy /ˈmoʊl.di/: <em>adjective (HAVING MOLD)</em> covered with mold:<br>moldy bread/cheese</li><li>biscuit /ˈbɪs.kɪt/: <em>noun (BREAD)</em> a type of bread usually baked in small, round pieces:<br>baking-powder biscuits<br>biscuits and gravy</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.</p><p>The goblin looked at it closely.</p><p>“That seems to be in order.”</p><p>“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”</p><p>The goblin read the letter carefully.</p><p>“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”</p><blockquote><p>Griphook 是另一个妖精,带着哈利和海格去 713 号地下金库取宝物和哈利父母留给哈利的财宝.</p></blockquote><p>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</p><p>“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”</p><p>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more <u>marble</u>, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small <u>cart</u> came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.</p><blockquote><ul><li>marble /ˈmɑːr.bəl/: <em>noun (ROCK)</em> a type of very hard rock that has a pattern of lines going through it, feels cold, and can be polished to become smooth and shiny:<br>a marble floor/statue</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marble_noun_002_22381.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of marble"></p><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of cart"></p></blockquote><p>At first they just <u>hurtled</u> through a <u>maze</u> of <u>twisting</u> <u>passages</u>. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The <u>rattling</u> cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.</p><blockquote><ul><li>hurtle /ˈhɝː.t̬əl/: <em>verb [ I usually + adv/prep ]</em> to move very fast, especially in a way that seems dangerous:<br>The truck came hurtling toward us.<br>The explosion sent pieces of metal and glass hurtling through the air.</li><li>maze /meɪz/: <em>noun (PLACE)</em> a complicated system of paths or passages that people try to find their way through for entertainment</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/maze_noun_002_22730.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of maze"></p><ul><li>twisting /ˈtwɪs·tɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> having a lot of turns or changes of direction:<br>a twisting country road</li><li>passage /ˈpæs.ɪdʒ/: <em>noun (CONNECTING WAY)</em> a usually long and narrow part of a building with rooms on one or both sides, or a covered path that connects places:<br>A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden.<br>The bathroom’s on the right at the end of the passage.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/passag_noun_002_26656.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of passage"></p><ul><li>rattle /ˈræt̬.əl/: <em>verb (WORRY)</em> a sound similar to a series of quickly repeated knocks:<br>From across the town came the rattle of machine-gun fire.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/rattle_noun_002_30214.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of rattle"></p></blockquote><p>Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge <u>stalactites</u> and <u>stalagmites</u> grew from the <u>ceiling</u> and floor.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stalactite /stə.ˈlæk.taɪt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a column of rock that hangs from the roof of a cave and is formed over a very long period of time by drops of water containing lime falling from the roof</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stalac_noun_002_35561.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stalactite"></p><ul><li>stalagmite /stə.ˈlæɡ.maɪt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a column of rock that rises from the floor of a cave, formed over a very long period of time by drops of water containing lime falling from the roof of the cave</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stalag_noun_002_35562.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stalagmite"></p><ul><li>ceiling /ˈsiː.lɪŋ/: <em>noun (TOP OF A ROOM)</em> the inside surface of a room that you can see when you look above you</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/ceilin_noun_002_06013.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of ceiling"></p></blockquote><p>“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”</p><p>“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p><p>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</p><p>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry <u>gasped</u>. Inside were <u>mounds</u> of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gasp /ɡæsp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to take a short, quick breath through the mouth, especially because of surprise, pain, or shock:<br>When she saw the money hidden in the box she gasped in surprise.<br>[ + speech ] “Help me!” he gasped.</li><li>mound /maʊnd/: <em>noun (PILE)</em> a large pile of earth, stones, etc. like a small hill:<br>a burial mound (= a place where people were buried in ancient times)</li></ul></blockquote><p>“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.</p><p>All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small <u>fortune</u> belonging to him, buried deep under London.</p><blockquote><ul><li>fortune /ˈfɔːr.tʃuːn/: <em>noun (WEALTH)</em> a large amount of money, goods, property, etc.:<br>She inherited a fortune from her grandmother.<br>He lost a fortune gambling.<br>You can make a fortune out of junk if you call it antiques.<br>This dress cost a (small) fortune.<br>Any painting by Van Gogh is worth a fortune.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</p><p>“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”</p><blockquote><p>金币是Galleons</p><p>银币是Sickles</p><p>青铜币是Knuts</p><p>1 Galleons = 17 Sickles</p><p>1 Sickles = 29 Knuts</p></blockquote><p>“One speed only,” said Griphook.</p><p>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the <u>scruff</u> of his neck.</p><blockquote><ul><li>scruff /skrʌf/: <em>noun (NECK)</em> by the skin at the back of the neck:<br>Cats carry their kittens by the scruff of the neck.<br>I took/grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him out of the hall.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</p><p>“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.</p><p>“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.</p><p>“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.</p><p>“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.</p><p>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.</p><p>“Come on, back in this <u>infernal</u> cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.</p><blockquote><ul><li>infernal /ɪnˈfɝː.nəl/: <em>adjective</em> very bad or unpleasant:<br>What an infernal noise!</li></ul></blockquote><p>One wild <u>cart</u> ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.</p><blockquote><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.177" alt="picture of cart"></p></blockquote><p>“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.</p><p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.</p><p>“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”</p><h2 id="初遇马尔福"><a href="#初遇马尔福" class="headerlink" title="初遇马尔福"></a>初遇马尔福</h2><p>In the back of the shop, a boy with a <u>pale</u>, <u>pointed</u> face was standing on a <u>footstool</u> while a <u>second</u> <u>witch</u> pinned up his long black <u>robes</u>.

The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.</p><blockquote><p>这里跟电影版有点不一样，电影中夸张了这里的情节，认为如果是不合适的魔杖挥一下就会搞破坏，但是原文中奥利凡德先生就是让哈利拿一下魔杖就知道这个魔杖合不合适他（最多挥一下），而且让哈利试了很多很多魔杖。</p></blockquote><p>“<u>Tricky</u> customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — <u>holly</u> and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>tricky /ˈtrɪk.i/: <em>adjective (DIFFICULT)</em> If a piece of work or problem is tricky, it is difficult to deal with and needs careful attention or skill: 挑剔的<br>It’s tricky to learn to ride a skateboard, but you never forget how.<br>I’m in a tricky situation - whatever I do I’ll offend someone.</li><li>holly /ˈhɑː.li/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a small evergreen tree (= one that never loses its leaves) with shiny, sharp leaves and small, round, red fruit.

He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold <u>sparks</u> shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid <u>whooped</u> and <u>clapped</u> and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how <u>curious</u> . . . how very curious . . .”</p><blockquote><ul><li>spark /spɑːrk/: <em>noun (FIRE/ELECTRICITY)</em> a very small piece of fire that flies out from something that is burning, or one that is made by rubbing two hard things together, or a flash of light made by electricity:<br>Sparks were flying out of the bonfire and blowing everywhere.<br>You can start a fire by rubbing two dry pieces of wood together until you produce a spark.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/spark_noun_002_34982.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of spark"></p><ul><li>whoop /wuːp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to give a loud, excited shout, especially to show your enjoyment of or agreement with something:<br>The audience was whooping and clapping.</li><li>clap /klæp/: <em>verb (MAKE NOISE)</em> to make a short loud noise by hitting your hands together:<br>“When I clap my hands, you stand still,” said the teacher.<br>The band played a familiar tune which had everyone clapping along.<br>The audience clapped in time to the music.</li><li>curious /ˈkjʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (INTERESTED)</em> interested in learning about people or things around you:<br>I was curious to know what would happen next.奇妙的<br>Babies are curious about everything around them.<br>“Why did you ask?” “I was just curious.”</li></ul></blockquote><p>He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”</p><p>“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”</p><p>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale <u>stare</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stare /ster/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking: 凝视<br>Don’t stare at people like that, it’s rude.<br>Chuck sat quietly for hours staring into the distance, thinking of what might have been.<br>During the press conference, each boxer tried to stare the other down (= force the other to look away by continual staring).</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be <u>destined</u> for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>destined /ˈdes.tɪnd/: <em>adjective (PURPOSE)</em> intended (for a particular purpose): 注定<br>The money was destined for the relief of poverty, but was diverted by corrupt officials.<br>These cars are destined for the European market.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry <u>swallowed</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swallow /ˈswɑː.loʊ/: <em>verb (THROAT)</em> to cause food, drink, pills, etc. to move from your mouth into your stomach by using the muscles of your throat: 由于紧张害怕而做吞咽动作。<br>My throat is so sore that it really hurts when I swallow.<br>He put a grape into his mouth and swallowed it whole.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”</p><p>Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.</p><blockquote><p>哈利的魔杖是十三英寸半场的紫杉木和凤凰尾羽。7加隆买下的。</p></blockquote><p>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were <u>gawking</u> at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s <u>lap</u>. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gawk /ɡɑːk/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to look at something or someone in a stupid or rude way:呆呆地看<br>Don’t sit there gawking like that - give me a hand!<br>They just stood there gawking at me.</li><li>lap /læp/: <em>noun (LEGS)</em> the top surface of the upper part of the legs of a person who is sitting down: 坐下的人的腿上面<br>Come and sit on my lap and I’ll read you a story.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.</p><p>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.</p><p>“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.</p><p>“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”</p><p>Hagrid <u>leaned</u> across the table. Behind the <u>wild</u> <u>beard</u> and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.</p><blockquote><ul><li>lean /liːn/: <em>adjective (NO FAT)</em> to (cause to) slope in one direction, or to move the top part of the body in a particular direction: 探身<br>She leaned forward and whispered something in my ear.<br>I sat down next to Bernard, who leaned over to me and said “You’re late.”<br>Lean your head back a little.<br>That fence is leaning to the right.</li><li>wild /waɪld/: <em>adjective (NOT CONTROLLED)</em> uncontrolled, violent, or extreme: 杂乱的<br>a wild party<br>wild dancing<br>The audience burst into wild applause.<br>When I told him what I’d done, he went wild (= became very angry).<br>The children were wild with excitement (= were extremely excited).<br>Her eyes were wild/She had a wild look in her eyes (= her eyes were wide open, as if frightened or mentally ill).<br>His hair was wild (= long and messy) and his clothes full of holes.<br>There have been wild (= extreme) variations in the level of spending.<br>They get some wild weather (= many severe storms) in the north.<br>It was a wild (= stormy or very windy) night, with the wind howling and the rain pouring down.</li><li>beard /bɪrd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the hair that some men allow to grow on the lower part of their face:<br>a flowing white beard<br>He’s growing a beard.<br>He shaved off his beard but kept his mustache.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/beard_noun_002_02901.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of beard"></p></blockquote><p>“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”</p><p>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</p><p>“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.”</p><blockquote><p>海格给哈利送上了回德思礼家的火车，并且给了他去霍格沃茨的车票。九月一号，国王十字车站。</p></blockquote><p>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he <u>rose in his seat</u> and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</p><blockquote><p> rose in his seat 翻译成跪在他的座位上。</p></blockquote>]]></content>

They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake.</p><p>“Where’s the <u>cannon</u>?” he said stupidly.</p><blockquote><p>cannon: noun [C] (GUN) a large, powerful gun, usually attached to two or four wheels, that was used in the past to fire heavy stone or metal balls:</p></blockquote><p>There was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came <u>skidding</u> into the room. He was holding a <u>rifle</u> in his hands — now they knew what had been in the long, thin package he had brought with them.</p><blockquote><ul><li>skid /skɪd/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> (especially of a vehicle) to slide along a surface so that you have no control:<br>Tony’s car skidded on some ice and hit a tree.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/skid_noun_002_34038.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of skid"></p><ul><li>rifle /ˈraɪ.fəl/: <em>noun (GUN)</em> a type of gun with a long barrel (= part shaped like a tube), fired from the shoulder and designed to be accurate at long distances</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/rifle_noun_002_31186.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of rifle"></p></blockquote><p>“Who’s there?” he shouted. “I warn you — I’m armed!”</p><p>There was a pause. Then SMASH!</p><p>The door was hit with such force that it <u>swung</u> clean off its <u>hinges</u> and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</p><blockquote><p>swing: <em>verb</em> (MOVE SIDEWAYS) to move easily and without interruption backward and forward or from one side to the other, especially from a fixed point, or to cause something or someone to do this:</p><p>hinge: noun [ C ] a piece of metal that fastens the edge of a door, window, lid, etc. to something else and allows it to open or close:</p><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/hinge_noun_002_17808.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of hinge"></p></blockquote><p>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black <u>beetles</u> under all the hair.</p><blockquote><p>beetle: <em>noun [ C ]</em> an insect with a hard shell-like back:</p><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/beetle_noun_002_03022.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of beetle"></p></blockquote><p>The giant <u>squeezed</u> his way into the <u>hut</u>, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.</p><blockquote><p>squeeze /skwiːz/: <em>verb (PRESS)</em> to press something firmly, especially from all sides in order to change its shape, reduce its size, or remove liquid from it:</p><p>hut /hʌt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, simple building, usually consisting of one room:</p></blockquote><p>“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey. . . .”</p><p>He strode over to the sofa where Dudley sat <u>frozen</u> with fear.</p><blockquote><p>freeze /friːz/: <em>verb (COLD)</em> If you freeze something, you lower its temperature below 32° F , causing it to become cold and often hard, and if something freezes, its temperature goes below 32° F:</p></blockquote><p>“<u>Budge up</u>, yeh great <u>lump</u>,” said the stranger.</p><blockquote><p>budge /bʌdʒ/ up: said to someone in order to ask him or her to move so that there is room for you</p><p>lump /lʌmp/: <em>noun (PIECE)</em> a piece of a solid substance, usually with no particular shape:</p></blockquote><p>Dudley <u>squeaked</u> and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</p><blockquote><p>squeak /skwiːk/: <em>verb (SOUND)</em> to make a short, very high cry or sound:</p></blockquote><p>“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.</p><p>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.</p><p>“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like <u>yer</u> dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”</p><blockquote><p>yer /jɚ/: <em>determiner</em> your:</p></blockquote><p>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</p><p>“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!”</p><p>“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great <u>prune</u>,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a <u>knot</u> as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>prune /pruːn/: <em>verb (CUT)</em> to cut off branches from a tree, bush, or plant, especially so that it will grow better in the future:</p></li><li><p>knot /nɑːt/: <em>noun (FASTENING)</em> a join made by tying together the ends of a piece or pieces of string, rope, cloth, etc.:<br>to tie a knot</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/knot_noun_002_20382.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of knot"></p></blockquote><p>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.</p><p>“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got <u>summat</u> fer <u>yeh</u> here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>summat /ˈsʌm.ət/: <em>pronoun</em> something:<br>There’s summat wrong with this machine.</p></li><li><p>yeh /jeə/: -&gt; you [accent]</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly <u>squashed</u> box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, <u>sticky</u> chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.</p><blockquote><p>squash /skwɑːʃ/: <em>verb (MAKE FLAT)</em> to crush something into a flat shape:</p><p>sticky /ˈstɪk.i/: <em>adjective (NOT DRY/SMOOTH)</em> made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches:</p></blockquote><p>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”</p><p>The giant chuckled.</p><p>“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”</p><p>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.</p><p>“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”</p><blockquote><p>海格说面对比自己强的人不要说没有茶。（对强者怀有敬意）</p></blockquote><p>His eyes fell on the empty <u>grate</u> with the <u>shriveled</u> chip bags in it and he <u>snorted</u>. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a <u>roaring</u> fire there. It filled the whole <u>damp</u> hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.</p><blockquote><ul><li>grate /ɡreɪt/: <em>verb (COOKING)</em> to rub food against a grater in order to cut it into a lot of small pieces:<br>grated cheese</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/grate_noun_002_16389.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of grate"></p><ul><li>shriveled /ˈʃrɪv.əld/: <em>adjective</em> dry, smaller than normal, and covered with lines as if by crushing or folding:<br>Those oranges were looking old and shriveled, so I threw them out.<br>All I had was two shriveled potatoes.<br>a bent and shriveled old man</li><li>snort /snɔːrt/: <em>verb</em> to make an explosive sound by forcing air quickly up or down the nose:<br>He did an impression of a horse snorting.<br>Camille snorts when she laughs.<br>informal By this time I was snorting with laughter (= laughing a lot and loudly).</li><li>roaring /ˈrɔːr.ɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> loud and powerful:<br>the roaring wind<br>a roaring fire</li><li>damp /dæmp/: <em>adjective</em> slightly wet, especially in a way that is not pleasant or comfortable:<br>The grass is still damp.<br>This shirt still feels a little damp.<br>It was a damp, misty morning.<br>Compare<br>humid<br>moist</li></ul></blockquote><p>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper <u>kettle</u>, a <u>squashy</u> package of <u>sausages</u>, a <u>poker</u>, a teapot, several chipped <u>mugs</u>, and a bottle of some <u>amber</u> liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley <u>fidgeted</u> a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”</p><p>The giant chuckled darkly.</p><blockquote><ul><li>kettle /ˈket̬.əl/: <em>noun (EQUIPMENT)</em> a container for boiling water, that has a lid, handle, and spout and is made from plastic or metal</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/kettle_noun_002_20140.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of kettle"></p><ul><li>squashy /ˈskwɑː.ʃi/: <em>adjective</em> soft and easy to crush:<br>I’ve bought some squashy pillows for the couch.</li><li>sausage /ˈsɑː.sɪdʒ/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a thin, tube-like case containing meat that has been cut into very small pieces and mixed with spices:<br>fried/grilled pork sausages<br>half a pound of sausage</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/sausag_noun_002_32177.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of sausage"></p><ul><li>poker /ˈpoʊ.kɚ/: <em>noun (GAME)</em> a game played with cards in which people try to win money from each other</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/poker_noun_002_28229.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of poker"></p><ul><li>mug /mʌɡ/: <em>noun (CUP)</em> a large cup with straight sides used for hot drinks:<br>I made myself a large mug of cocoa (= enough to fill a mug) and went to bed.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/mug_noun_002_24187.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of mug"></p><ul><li>amber /ˈæm.bɚ/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> a hard, transparent, yellowish-brown substance that was formed in ancient times from resin (= a substance produced by trees) and is used in jewelry:<br>He has a collection of prehistoric insects preserved in amber.<br>Greek philosophers discovered that when amber is rubbed against cloth, lightweight objects will stick to it.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/amber_noun_002_00895.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of amber"></p><ul><li>fidget /ˈfɪdʒ.ət/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to make continuous, small movements that annoy other people:<br>Children can’t sit still for long without fidgeting.<br>Stop fidgeting!</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yer great puddin’ of a son don’ need fattenin’ anymore, Dursley, don’ worry.”</p><p>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”</p><p>The giant took a <u>gulp</u> of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gulp /ɡʌlp/: <em>verb</em> to eat or drink food or liquid quickly by swallowing it in large amounts, or to make a swallowing movement because of fear, surprise, or excitement:<br>She gulped down her drink and made a hasty exit.<br>When it was his turn to dive, he gulped and stepped up onto the diving board.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”</p><p>“Er — no,” said Harry.</p><p>Hagrid looked shocked.</p><p>“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.</p><p>“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”</p><p>“All what?” asked Harry.</p><p>“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”</p><p>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</p><p>“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”</p><p>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.</p><p>“I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and <u>stuff</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>stuff /stʌf/: <em>noun (THING(S))</em> a substance, especially when you do not know or say exactly what it is:<br>There’s sticky stuff all over the chair.<br>What’s this black stuff?<br>He drinks gallons of tea - he loves the stuff.</li></ul></blockquote><p>But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents’ world.”</p><p>“What world?” Hagrid looked as if he was about to <u>explode</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>explode /ɪkˈsploʊd/: <em>verb (BREAK APART)</em> to break up into pieces violently, or to cause something to do this:<br>A bomb exploded at one of the capital’s busiest railroad stations this morning.<br>He was driving so fast that his car tire exploded.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“DURSLEY!” he boomed.</p><p>Uncle Vernon, who had gone very <u>pale</u>, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.</p><blockquote><ul><li>pale /peɪl/: <em>adjective</em> used to describe a person’s face or skin if it has less color than usual, for example when the person is or sick or frightened, or if it has less color than people generally have:<br>You’re looking pale - are you feeling well?<br>She has a naturally pale complexion and dark hair.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”</p><p>“What? My — my mom and dad weren’t famous, were they?” “Yeh don’ know . . . yeh don’ know . . .” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry with a <u>bewildered</u> stare.</p><blockquote><ul><li>bewildered /bɪˈwɪl.dɚd/: <em>adjective</em> confused and uncertain:<br>Arriving in a strange city at night, I felt alone and bewildered.<br>I came out of the movie a bit bewildered, but I enjoyed it.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yeh don’ know what yeh are?” he said finally.</p><p>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</p><p>“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir!

An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”</p><p>Harry <u>stretched</u> out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in <u>emerald</u> green to Mr. H.

After a few minutes he <u>stammered</u>, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a <u>cart</u> horse, and from yet another pocket inside his <u>overcoat</u> he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long <u>quill</u>, and a roll of <u>parchment</u>. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:</p><p>Dear Professor Dumbledore, Given Harry his letter.</p><p>Taking him to buy his things tomorrow. Weather’s horrible. Hope you’re well.

Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.</p><p>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.</p><p>“He’s not going,” he said.</p><p>Hagrid <u>grunted</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>clamp /klæmp/: <em>verb (FASTEN)</em> a device made of wood or metal that is used to hold two things together tightly:<br>Carefully tighten the clamp until it firmly supports the pipette in a vertical position.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/clamp_noun_002_06990.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of clamp"></p><ul><li>grunt /ɡrʌnt/: <em>noun (LOW SOUND)</em> (of a pig) to make a low, rough noise:<br>The pigs were grunting contentedly as they ate their food.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.</p><p>“A what?” said Harry, interested.</p><p>“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”</p><p>“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”</p><p>“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”</p><p>“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my <u>dratted</u> sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog <u>spawn</u>, turning teacups into <u>rats</u>. I was the only one who saw her for what she was — a <u>freak</u>! But for my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud of having a witch in the family!”</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>dratted: <em>adj.</em> Damned; confounded.</p></li><li><p>spawn /spɑːn/: <em>noun (EGGS)</em> the eggs of fish, frogs, etc.</p></li><li><p>rat /ræt/: <em>noun (ANIMAL)</em> a small rodent, larger than a mouse, that has a long tail and is considered to be harmful:<br>Rats carry disease.<br>I think we’ve got rats (= there are rats in our house).</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/rat_noun_001_13390.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of rat"></p><ul><li>freak /friːk/: <em>noun (STRANGE)</em> a thing, person, animal, or event that is extremely unusual or unlikely, and not like any other of its type:<br>I was born with black hair all over my back, like some sort of freak.<br>The pearl is so big that it has been described as a freak of nature.<br>humorous At my school you were considered to be a freak if you weren’t interested in sports.</li></ul></blockquote><p>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.</p><p>“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself <u>blown up</u> and we got landed with you!”</p><blockquote><ul><li>blow /bloʊ/ up: <em>noun (STORM)</em> When a storm blows up, it begins.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”</p><p>“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!”</p><p>“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.</p><p>The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”</p><p>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.</p><p>“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . .”</p><p>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”</p><p>“Who?”</p><p>“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .”</p><p>Hagrid <u>gulped</u>, but no words came out.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gulp /ɡʌlp/: <em>verb</em> to eat or drink food or liquid quickly by swallowing it in large amounts, or to make a swallowing movement because of fear, surprise, or excitement:<br>She gulped down her drink and made a hasty exit.<br>When it was his turn to dive, he gulped and stepped up onto the diving board.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.</p><p>“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid <u>shuddered</u>. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly. One o’ the only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore’s the only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn’t dare try takin’ the school, not jus’ then, anyway.</p><blockquote><ul><li>shudder /ˈʃʌd.ɚ/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to shake suddenly with very small movements because of a very unpleasant thought or feeling:<br>The sight of so much blood made him shudder.<br>She shuddered at the thought of kissing him.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Now, yer mum an’ dad were as good a witch an’ wizard as I ever knew. Head boy an’ girl at Hogwarts in their day! Suppose the myst’ry is why You-Know-Who never tried to get ’em on his side before . . . probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin’ ter do with the Dark Side.</p><p>“Maybe he thought he could persuade ’em . . . maybe he just wanted ’em outta the way. All anyone knows is, he turned up in the village where you was all living, on Halloween ten years ago. You was just a year old. He came ter yer house an’ — an’ —”</p><blockquote><p>10 月 30 日伏地魔杀死了哈利的父母</p></blockquote><p>Hagrid suddenly pulled out a very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose with a sound like a foghorn.</p><blockquote><ul><li>foghorn /ˈfɑːɡ.hɔːrn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a horn that makes a very loud sound to warn ships that they are close to land or other ships:<br>He has a voice like a foghorn (= an unpleasantly loud voice).</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/foghor_noun_002_14511.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of foghorn"></p></blockquote><p>“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . .</p><p>“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then. But he couldn’t do it. Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That’s what yeh get when a powerful, evil curse touches yeh — took care of yer mum an’ dad an’ yer house, even — but it didn’t work on you, an’ that’s why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ’em, no one except you, an’ he’d killed some o’ the best witches an’ wizards of the age — the McKinnons, the Bones, the Prewetts — an’ you was only a baby, an’ you lived.”</p><blockquote><p>伏地魔杀死了McKinnons夫妇、Bones夫妇、Prewetts夫妇。</p></blockquote><p>Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.</p><p>Hagrid was watching him sadly.</p><p>“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .”</p><p>“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.</p><p>“Now, you listen here, boy,” he <u>snarled</u>, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end —”</p><blockquote><ul><li>snarl /snɑːrl/: <em>verb (SOUND)</em> (especially of dogs) to make a deep, rough sound while showing the teeth, usually in anger or (of people) to speak or say something angrily and forcefully:<br>The dogs started to snarl at each other so I had to separate them.<br>[ + speech ] “Go to hell!”, he snarled.</li></ul></blockquote><p>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word . . .”</p><p>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a <u>bearded</u> <u>giant</u>, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.</p><blockquote><ul><li>beard /bɪrd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the hair that some men allow to grow on the lower part of their face:<br>a flowing white beard<br>He’s growing a beard.<br>He shaved off his beard but kept his mustache.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/beard_noun_002_02901.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of beard"></p><ul><li>giant /ˈdʒaɪ.ənt/: <em>noun (VERY TALL PERSON)</em> an imaginary creature like a man but extremely tall, strong, and usually very cruel, appearing especially in children’s stories</li></ul></blockquote><p>“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.</p><p>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.</p><p>“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”</p><p>“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see . . . he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?</p><p>“Some say he died. <u>Codswallop</u>, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.</p><blockquote><ul><li>codswallop /ˈkɑːdzˌwɑː.ləp/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> nonsense:<br>What a load of codswallop!</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”</p><p>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being <u>clouted</u> by Dudley, and <u>bullied</u> by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest <u>sorcerer</u> in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?</p><blockquote><ul><li>clout /klaʊt/: <em>noun (POWER)</em> to hit someone or something with the hand or with a heavy object:<br>Quigley clouted me smartly across the side of the head.</li><li>bully /ˈbʊl.i/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> someone who hurts or frightens someone else, often over a period of time, and often forcing them to do something that they do not want to do:<br>You’re just a big bully!<br>Teachers usually know who the bullies are in a class.</li><li>sorcerer /ˈsɔːr.sɚ.ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> in stories, a man who has magical powers and who uses them to harm other people</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”</p><p>To his surprise, Hagrid <u>chuckled</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>chuckle /ˈtʃʌk.əl/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to laugh quietly:<br>She was chuckling as she read the letter.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?”</p><p>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle <u>furious</u> with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his <u>revenge</u>, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?</p><blockquote><ul><li>furious /ˈfʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (ANGRY)</em> extremely angry:<br>I was late and he was furious with me.<br>He’s furious about/at the way he’s been treated.<br>We had a furious debate about the death penalty.</li><li>revenge /rɪˈvendʒ/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> harm done to someone as a punishment for harm that they have done to someone else:<br>She took/got/exacted (her) revenge on him for leaving her by smashing up his car.<br>He is believed to have been shot by a rival gang in revenge for the shootings last week.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry looked back at Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was <u>positively</u> <u>beaming</u> at him.</p><blockquote><ul><li>positively /ˈpɑː.zə.t̬ɪv.li/: <em>adverb (WELL)</em> in a good or positive way:<br>I don’t respond very positively to being bossed around - it just makes me angry</li><li>beaming /ˈbiː.mɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> used to describe a smile that is very wide and happy, or someone who is smiling in this way:<br>a beaming smile</li></ul></blockquote><p>“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”</p><p>But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.</p><p>“Haven’t I told you he’s not going? ” he <u>hissed</u>. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”</p><blockquote><ul><li>hiss /hɪs/: <em>verb</em> to make a noise like a long s sound:<br>Why do snakes hiss?<br>The iron was hissing and spluttering.<br>People in the audience were hissing their disapproval.</li><li>wand /wɑːnd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a special thin stick waved by a person who is performing magic tricks:<br>The fairy godmother waved her magic wand over the cabbages and they turned into horses.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/wand_noun_002_40498.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of wand"></p></blockquote><p>“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—”</p><p>“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.</p><p>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT OF — ME!”</p><p>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his <u>trousers</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>trousers /ˈtraʊ.zɚz/: <em>noun [ plural ]</em> a piece of clothing that covers the lower part of the body from the waist to the feet, consisting of two cylinder-shaped parts, one for each leg, that are joined at the top:<br>I need a new pair of trousers to go with this jacket.<br>Why aren’t you wearing any trousers, David?</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/trouse_noun_001_18227.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of trousers"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>电影里是因为达力偷吃蛋糕，才被变的猪尾巴。</p></blockquote><p>Uncle Vernon <u>roared</u>. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the other room, he cast one last terrified look at Hagrid and slammed the door behind them.</p><blockquote><ul><li>roar /rɔːr/: <em>verb</em> to make a long, loud, deep sound:<br>We could hear the lions roaring at the other end of the zoo.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.</p><p>“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”</p><p>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.</p><p>“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —”</p><p>“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.</p><p>“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth.

I hope to be your friend.</p></li><li><p>I will copy this into my diary after you help me; if you want to share something with me that makes you happy, please write it down, I will be very happy to write it in my diary.</p></li></ul><p>Live Long and Prosper</p><p>LOL</p><p>If you are a naive English speaker and you want to practice Chinese and help me practice English you can send an email to me (<a href="mailto:firstandthen@126.com">firstandthen@126.com</a>), or send message on skype (<a href="https://join.skype.com/invite/xUPdthI9XQrf">https://join.skype.com/invite/xUPdthI9XQrf</a>), </p><hr><h2 id="Diary"><a href="#Diary" class="headerlink" title="Diary"></a>Diary</h2><p>I don’t know why I usually write the diary for the past day. I think it might because I need to think a lot about how to express my thoughts. When I write a diary in Chinese, I just “say” without too much consideration. So when I write diary in English, I spend so much time.</p><p>But I’m so lucky that every friend around me spends their time to correct my grammar and talk with me. I have good patience, and I like to talk with others. My friends suggested me <u>becoming</u> a Chinese language teacher the day before yesterday. That might come true, really. I felt a sense of achievement when I taught a friend to say “my name is …, and I’m from Saudi Arabia” in Chinese.</p><h3 id="July-18-2021"><a href="#July-18-2021" class="headerlink" title="July 18, 2021"></a>July 18, 2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>We had a team dinner last night, because our upperclasswoman (I’m not sure about how to express that word, might be “school-sister”?) was graduated successfully. She teached me a lot skills about how to communicate with others. Our research team is very harmonious and we treat each other like siblings.</p><h3 id="July-16-2021"><a href="#July-16-2021" class="headerlink" title="July 16, 2021"></a>July 16, 2021</h3><p>Rainy to sunny</p><p>It has been a long time since I wrote my last diary. There were so many things that happened these days. I went to Beijing last week for my PhD application with my master’s degree advisor. It’s not easy applying for a PhD. So we visited many teachers. Fortunately, many teachers appreciated my abilities. I think I have a good chance to be able to study in Beijing.</p><p>One of the most significant impressions I got when I stayed in Beijing was how crowded it was. Beijing is one of the most famous cities around the world. There are so many people living in Beijing. Many young people who work or go to school flock to the subway every morning. They didn’t seem familiar with each other, but the crowd pressed together. I was also one of them, I even felt the temperature from the strangers. I forgot when the last time I hugged someone was, but I’m afraid that I will feel the warmth of people this way in the future.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Hello again, Echo :)</p><p>I’m glad to hear your PhD applications went well. I wish you lots of fun in Beijing if you go there!</p><p>Did you get accepted already? Then you have “the” chance to study in Beijing. If what you’re trying to say is that you think your application went well, then you have “a chance” instead. I would say “I think I have a (good) chance to be able to study in Beijing.</p><p>One little note about the text is the one sentence where you wrote “we”. Don’t suddenly change the pronoun from singular to plural unless the context makes it clear there is another person involved. Throughout the whole thext, the only person I see who is applying in Beijing is you, so I never learnt who else would be included in “we”. Without the context, it makes no sense!</p><p>I’m pointing this out because I see a lot of Chinese people make this mistake (probably because pronouns work differently for you, I’m guessing).</p><blockquote><p>Hi Christian!</p><p>I’m really happy to receive your correction again :). I got that I shouldn’t suddenly change the pronoun. When I wrote “we visited many teachers” because my master’s degree advisor went to Beijing with me. But I didn’t explain this in my diary, so it made readers confused. I will notice it in my future diary.</p><p>And I didn’t get accepted already. I just have a change to take the exam. So I rewrote the sentence to “I have a good chance…”.</p><p>Hope you hava a nice day!</p></blockquote><p>And I’m happy to help =) </p><p>I read the text again and (I think) it’s good now! Your new version is better, now the change in pronoun makes sense!</p><p>Good luck with the exam!!</p></blockquote><h3 id="June-7-2021"><a href="#June-7-2021" class="headerlink" title="June 7,2021"></a>June 7,2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>Today, it is really hot. We bought a mobile air conditioner, but the after-sales department told us that we should wait several days until they have the mounting hardware. So we have to bear the hot weather for now. Christian told me that he went to the bouldering hall yesterday. I know that there is a bouldering hall in the shopping mall near our college, but I have never attempted to go climbing there. I don’t know if climbing is popular in China. I know that I seldom hear my friends say they’ll go climbing. I guess maybe climbing is popular in some big cities in China, but the city where I live is so small, people usually work out at the gym. Basketball or table tennis is more likely to be the first choice for them.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>If you want to use “mobile air conditioning”, you have to drop the definite article and just say “We bought mobile air conditioning”. Otherwise, it will make me think you are talking about a specific machine that you mentioned before. However, the reader lacks the context here, and because of that it ends up sounding incorrect.</p><p>If you say you “hear [your] friends go climbing”, it means that you are somewhere completely else but they are soooo loud while climbing that you can still hear them…</p><p>so that’s why you need to say you rarely hear them say that they’ll go climbing.</p><p>If your friends go climbing again, why don’t you give it a shot? :) My friend had suggested it more than once but I was kinda scared to go, too. Eventually, I gave in and I was very surprised by how much I liked it. Maybe it’s not your thing, but you have to try to know! I definitely recommend going with friends, though, it’s much more fun that way.</p></blockquote><h3 id="June-6-2021"><a href="#June-6-2021" class="headerlink" title="June 6,2021"></a>June 6,2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>After several days of rest, I resumed my English studies. I need to stay up late as little as possible. Recent experience tells me that if I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency becomes lower, and my ability to memorize things decreases. The loss outweighs the gain.</p><p>Tomorrow is the College Entrance Examination, which is vital for most Chinese students. I passed that exam many years before. Even though many years have passed since, I can recall it very well. I was so nervous during the exam. And I really hope the students who will take that exam tomorrow will get a good grade. In China, studying at a good college is really important for the future life. Because a good college means better educational sources, better career opportunities, even wider views.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>“If I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency will become lower” isn’t completely incorrect. I do think that as a general statement, the zero conditional works well here to reinforce that. But your version works as well.</p><p>I think by “my memory decreases” you meant to say that you get worse and learning things by heart. I corrected your text with that meaning in mind. What you wrote, “my memory decreases”, sounds very strange. But more importantly, without context, I would have thought what you’re trying to say is that you lose memories or the ability to remember things at all (the way people with dementia or Alzehimer’s disease might do).</p><p>Also watch out for the wrong prepositions that I corrected :)</p><p>Today I went to the bouldering hall and now I’m pretty beat. Is climbing popular in China, too? It’s become a trend in Europe in the last decade or so.</p><blockquote><p>Hi Christian! Thanks for your correction. Here is my note:</p><ol><li><p>Zero Conditional</p><p>In zero conditional sentences, the tense in both parts of the sentence is the <strong>simple present</strong>.In zero conditional sentences, we can replace “if” with “when”, because both express general truths. The meaning will be unchanged.</p><p>The zero conditional is used to make statements about the real world, and often refers to general truths, such as scientific facts. In these sentences, the time is <strong>now or always</strong> and the situation is <strong>real and possible</strong>.</p><p>e.g. If I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency becomes lower.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="left">If clause (condition)</th><th align="left">Main clause (result)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><strong>If + simple present</strong></td><td align="left"><strong>simple present</strong></td></tr><tr><td align="left">If this thing happens</td><td align="left">that thing happens.</td></tr></tbody></table></li><li><p>“the memory decreases” vs “the ability to memorize things decreases”</p><p>the memory decreases -&gt; memory loss due to illness</p><p>the ability to memorize things decreases -&gt; can’t remember something</p></li><li><p>right prepositions</p><ul><li><p>study at a good college</p></li><li><p>is important for the future life</p></li></ul></li></ol></blockquote><p>Hey again, Echo.</p><p>Just a little improvement for your notes:</p><p>When <code>the ability to memorize things decreases</code>, you can’t MAKE yourself remember something NEW.</p><p>When <code>your memory becomes worse</code> (“memory decreases” sounds a bit unnatural), you stop being able to remember things that happened in the past well. It doesn’t have to be from illness, it is said that people’s memory declines (get worse) as they age in general.</p><p>Instead of decrease, use the word “decline” in this situation! The common collocations in this context may be a bit hard to figure out unless you’ve read about it previously.</p></blockquote><h3 id="June-2-2021"><a href="#June-2-2021" class="headerlink" title="June 2, 2021"></a>June 2, 2021</h3><p>Rainy</p><p>There was heavy rain yesterday. I stayed in the laboratory and met with friends online. And yesterday was also the Children’s Day. A strange phenomenon has appeared these years that even adults celebrate the Children’s Day. Many of my friends received money from their parents and received candies from their friends. Many of my friends usually call themselves a baby. All grownups were once children, and I think they never forget that. And a new policy has been introduced in China. Families can have a third child now.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>You start a lot of sentences with “And”, Echo. In colloquial texts like chat messages or in informal speech, this is absolutely fine. But if you want to practice you writing, I think you should try to get rid of this habit. In a formal text, you should use other conjunctions that go at the start of a sentence, because “and” should only really be used to connect two sentences together, not to start one.</p><p>I know you realized that with “these days” you should use the simple present, and “these years” really does work in a similar way. However, here I would definitely suggest usage of the present perfect. The appearance of a strange phenomenon is not a general statement about “these years”,  because it is a development. The word “appear” already has this written all over it. Because a phenomenon can only start to appear once, you can’t make this a general statement.</p><p>You could say “These years, even adults celebrate Children’s Day”, this sentence works perfectly fine in simple present!</p><p>But with “Even adults have started to celebrate”, you’d need to use the present perfect, and your sentence with “appear” has the same problem.</p><p>Hope this helps!</p><blockquote><p>Hi Christian! Thanks for your suggestion. I noticed that I use the word “and” too much. I will use “and” beside two sentences with logical connection.</p><p>I learnt that I prefer to use the present perfect because the “appear”  already happened, but “celebrate” have not this question.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-31-2021"><a href="#May-31-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 31, 2021"></a>May 31, 2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>These days, I spend almost my whole time studying English. And recently, I felt that I didn’t have enough time, so I stopped my running plan and my guitar training. I did so many IELTS exercises that I dreamed about the exam almost every day. But one thing abruptly came to my mind yesterday, which was that I need to have some balance. </p><p>When I was in high school, my parents told me I could enjoy my life when I came to university. When I came to university, my advisor said I could enjoy my life when I found a good job. My friend with a good job told me, his parents asked him to get married to his girlfriend and have a baby, then my friend could enjoy his life. My advisor who has two sons told me that he must work hard to earn money and feed his child. Few people around me have a balanced life indeed. I think many of us are slaves to our lives. Our lives aren’t really  happy, right?</p><p>Many professors in our school spend their weekend making meetings for their students and concentrating on scientific research. I think they are excellent teachers. But I would prefer to spend much more time with my family on weekends if I was a professor. Instead of studying all night, I would prefer to play the guitar in the evening, and then have a nice sleep. </p><p>We need to improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves. I haven’t seen a full sunset in a really long time.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Great text! :) You used a lot of difficult grammar and made few mistakes. I think you have improved since you started posting your texts here!</p><p>You can also say “to be a slave to/of life” but the meaning feels different. I think you’re trying to say is that everyone is a slave to their own circumstances, their own lives, so that’s how I corrected it.</p><p>“To improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves” isn’t really a sentence, since it lacks a subject. I think it still works here because you are just mentioning it as an idea rather than a statement, but I wanted to make that clear.</p><p>I have heard often that in China peer pressure and society’s expectations are very harsh. I don’t really feel fit to comment on this, since I’ve never been to China myself. But I also think that a relaxed attitude towards life is the right way to achieve happiness :) You shouldn’t listen to everyone’s advice, because it will not make you happy - even if it might work for them. I think some people might be very happy to work on weekends for their students’ sake. I personally think taking breaks is more important. But what’s truly important is that you take time to do the things that make you happy and that you learn to appreciate them at the same time.</p><blockquote><p>Hi Christian. Thanks for your help! Your careful correction really helps me a lot!</p><ol><li><p>I searched on dictionary, and I got the differents between “lives” and “life”, and I also got that “be a slave of (something)” is the same as “be a slave to (something)”.</p><p>-&gt; Life means the state that follows birth, and precedes death; the state of being alive and living when used as a noun.</p><p>-&gt; Lives is the correct plural form of the noun life, which is defined as a living being, especially a person.</p><p>For the above reasons, I should say “many of us are slaves to our lives” or “many of us are slaves of our lives”. Is that right?</p></li><li><p>And I have changed my word to “we need to improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves”. I think it’s more clearly. And thanks for your point.</p></li><li><p>“When I came to university, my advisor said I could enjoy my life when I found a good job.” In this sentence, it use “found” because of the subjunctive. Is that right? Because I’m a student now, and I will find a job in the future. The same reason as using “was” in folloing sentence, “I would prefer to spend much more time with my family on weekends if I was a professor.”</p></li><li><p>I also learnt that I should use the present tense when I say “these days”.</p></li></ol><p>Hope you have a nice day.</p></blockquote><p>Hey Echo,</p><p>1.) Yes, that’s the difference I was talking about :)</p><p>2.) Yes, I think that works as well!</p><p>3.) Exactly, the “found” comes from the subjunctive. If you look at your original text, you actually did this correctly in the sentence before where you wrote “I could enjoy my life when I came to university”. In this case, the “came” comes from the subjunctive.</p><p>In modern English, subjunctive isn’t necessarily used a lot anymore. However, in these sentences you still cannot use another tense. As an alternative way to explain this, you can imagine the sentences as conditional sentences (which is really what they are, even though you substituted the word if with when).</p><p>“My advisor said I could enjoy my life if (when) I found a good job.”</p><p>“If I found a good job, I could enjoy my life.”</p><p>If + simple past, main clause + conditional I (would + infinitive, but would can doesn’t exist and becomes could)</p><p>So in this case, I think modern English doesn’t really need the subjunctive to explain the grammar of the sentence anymore. There are other sentences in which the subjunctive is used (or was used commonly in the past, but is usually phrased differently in modern English) where you cannot explain the form of the verb in an alternative way, though.</p><p>4.) Yes, absolutely. If you want to use the past tense, you can say “The last few days”/“The last couple of days”/“Recently” + simple past/present perfect instead. Maybe you can tell that these expressions reach from the past to the present but don’t extend past it. “These days” talks about days in the past, but extends what you are saying to days in the future as well. It makes your statement sound more general, and as you know we use the simple present to talk about general statements.</p><p>EDIT: I wanted to add that actually, you can use the present perfect with “These days” as well. It’s just the simple past that sounds strange/incorrect.</p><p>I wish you a nice day as well! :D</p><blockquote><p>Thanks again! :) I have learned what you teached me except one thing.  Would you mind to tell me the meaning of “EDIT”. It’s my first time to see that. Forgive me that I don’t really understand where you “add”. And “use the present perfect with ‘These days’” is strange or incorrect, I guess?</p></blockquote><p>Editing is when you go back to change something in your text after you finish writing it. I made an edit to my comment after I posted it, so I wrote “EDIT”, then you know this is what I changed, that’s all.</p><p>This is also why I “added” this paragraph or this piece of information, because it was not previously in my comment.</p><p>And no, using the present perfect with “these days” is not strange or incorrect. Using the simple past is! That’s the thing I was trying to add to my previous correction :)</p><blockquote><p>Okay! I got it, really thanks!</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-29-2021"><a href="#May-29-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 29, 2021"></a>May 29, 2021</h3><p>Sunny to cloudy</p><p>Today I made two Iranian friends, Mahdi and Rana. They can both speak Farsi and English, and they came to China about one and a half years ago. Since they came to China, they have been learning Chinese. I think their Chinese is really good and I can get the meaning when they talk to me in Chinese. As Rana said, the Chinese language has too many tunes (the Beijing dialect uses four tones). So it’s hard for a Chinese language learner to pronounce things like a Chinese native speaker. But I think languages are just tools, we needn’t remember every word in that language or behave like natives. If we can talk to others and exchange our minds, I think it’s enough. They are both Muslims, like one of my best friends. Rana told me that a Muslim can only marry another Muslim, so he isn’t preparing to find a girlfriend in China. Both of them have really big families, with many brothers and sisters. In China, families have a maximum of two children. They can do many things in our school, like fishing, cooking, having parties, BBQ, etc. But Chinese students don’t have the permission to do so.  And they have just one roomate or even none. I think those things are really deserved by foreign students coming to study in China.</p><blockquote><blockquote><p>Hi Christian and thanks for your correction. I have corrected my diary, but I have one question. “they have came to China for about one and a half years”, is this sentence right? (I think I should use the present perfect.)</p><p>If I rewrite like “they came to China since about one and a half years ago”, it’s right.</p></blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/NAszxVOZ0RbIngBgpAUDQdTk5dU2">Lonely Stargazer</a></p><p>Hey again Echo,</p><p>I made a little mistake here myself. The correct version is “They came to China about one and a half years ago”, without “since”. You can also say “They have been in China for about one and a half years” or “They have been staying in China since one and a half years ago”.</p><p>Gramatically speaking the sentence “They have come to China for about one and a half years” is correct, but it doesn’t sound right to me. I get what it’s trying to say, but it sounds like they have been on their way to China for 1,5 years and not IN China for 1,5 years. Maybe it’s just me as a German though.</p><p>You could make it more clear by saying “They have come to stay in China for about one and a half years”.</p><p>I hope you were trying to say that your friends have been in China for 1,5 years now. If what you’re trying to say is they came to China a while ago and are going to stay for 1,5 years in total, you can’t use my first three sentences. In that case you can use the last sentence </p><p>“They have come to stay in China for about one and a half years”</p><p>or</p><p>“They came to China and will stay for about one and a half years”</p><p>or something like that.</p><p>I hope that makes sense to you now? Sorry if it’s confusing.</p><blockquote><p>It’s really helps me a lot! I choose “They came to China about one and a half years ago” as my final version. Thanks for your teaching.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-23-2021"><a href="#May-23-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 23, 2021"></a>May 23, 2021</h3><p>Cloudy to rainy</p><p>As I said yesterday, I will discuss the phenomenon of the growing number of learning anchors in modern China.</p><p>First of all, the most important reason is more and more students study with their classmates when they come to school. If you ask a Chinese student, who they spent the longest time with, he/she will most likely  say it was his/her classmates. As a result, they develop the habit of needing the company of others. So when students graduate from school or vacation at home, they want to have company, even if it’s from the Internet. One of the other reasons is that families from Chinese urban areas are often having only one child - these young children grow up without any brothers or sisters. So they really lack the care of their peers. Many of them become anchors in order to find people to talk or share their life with online to get more attention. Lastly, I won’t deny that many people become learning anchors just for selling their stationery to earn money.</p><p>As for me, I just want someone to stay with me and learn with me. Since I became a learning anchor, I have made a lot of friends. I’m so lucky to know them and their experience really encourages me. I will stick to it, like I usually say, “ we will meet at the top of the knowledge mountain”.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/NAszxVOZ0RbIngBgpAUDQdTk5dU2">Lonely Stargazer</a></p><p>Most of the mistakes here are either superflous words (e. g. increasing) or grammatical oddities (the present form of become sticks out - you are describing something that happened in the past, therefore the past tense). I suggest you revise the past/present/future tenses. I see you tried writing an essay using the usual template (topic sentence, first argument, second argument etc.). I suggest you look into that as well, it could help with any academic writing.</p><blockquote><p>Hi Lonely Stargazer,</p><p>Thanks for your correction, and I kown my grammar is not good, so I‘m’ reviewing my grammar knowledge these days, especially tenses knowledge. And I’m also preparing for the IELTS exam. So I use that usual template not just for academic writing but also the exam.</p><p>I see that Christian Bleischwitz helped you correct your posts. So I guess you must kown him. He is a really nice man. Because he really helped me a lot to my writting. And I think you are also a nice man.</p><p>Thanks again! :)</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-22-2021"><a href="#May-22-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 22, 2021"></a>May 22, 2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>I am an anchor on a Chinese website called Bilibili( live.bilibili.com/11652383 ). My live content is just studying. That sounds so strange, right? Because when we see the word “anchor”, what comes to mind is “live game streaming”. Many Chinese people, especially students want to have company while they are preparing for tests, such as postgraduate tests, IELTS tests, civil service exams, etc. As for me, I get efficient in my studies when I’m under supervision. So I turn on my camera, and share my study process with others online. I think the appearance of many learning anchors is a funny phenomenon, I will discuss it in my diary tomorrow.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Good text!</p><p>You can also say “what comes to our minds”, but don’t say “our mind” because that suggests everybody was thinking with just one brain…</p><p>I think “what comes to mind” without a pronoun is best anyway, because it’s supposed to sound like a general feeling applicable to anyone.</p><p>You can also say “I will discuss it in tomorrow’s diary”, but then drop the possesive pronoun (my). If you write “my tomorrow’s diary”, it’ll mean that tomorrow is yours and not the diary, so that doesn’t work. </p><p>In my correction above, the tomorrow is just a temporal adverb, technically meaning that the activity of writing take place tomorrow.</p><p>In the version “tomorrow’s diary”, it will technically mean that you will discuss it in the diary about the day tomorrow. Practically, it’s the same thing though since diary entries are usually written on the same day as their events.</p><blockquote><p>Hi Christian,</p><p>Thanks for your particular correction. I remember that I need to say “what comes to mind”.(I learn that using “our mind” is so funny and not rigorous, I will notice that.) And I also learn that “diary” is written for today, the word imply the time. So we should just say “my diary”, but not “my today’s diary’”. And “my tomorrow’s diary” is not good, the reason is the same as above.</p><p>Thanks again, hope you have a nice day!</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-21-2021"><a href="#May-21-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 21, 2021"></a>May 21, 2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>It has been several days since I wrote the last diary entry.

In my dream, things happened during the Republican period of China. There was a pair of lovers who decided to get married. In ancient China, people who wanted to get married needed to get permission from their parents.  So they went back home with their friends, and hoped the boy’s parents could hold the wedding for them. But several days before the wedding, one of the boy’s parents deceived the girl that he would take her to visit her parents. And the girl fell for it. He walked along an alley with the girl and stopped in front of the door of a big old house. He got rid of several black cats for luck, and then he kidnapped the girl with the help of the house owner. They took the girl on a train, and nobody knew where it went. The girl left a letter to the boy, it said: </p><p>My dear lover, when you see this letter, you won’t kown where I am. Our love couldn’t get the best of both worlds, but never forget me.</p><p>I guess the house owner was a warlord, so he could kidnap the girl and took her away. And the boy’s parents didn’t want their kid get married with the girl, because the parents thought the two young people weren‘t fit for each other. They were so cruel to break them up in that way in order to drop the boy’s idea forever. And I think traditional marriage in China often ended up with a tragedy. The parents usually made the engagement by themselves without considering their kids’ thoughts. The dream was really bad. And I feel so sorry for the two young people in my dream.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Wow, Echo! That’s a really long text. Well done!</p><p>The sentence “There was a pair of lovers and they were in love with each other.” is grammatically correct. But of course lovers are in love with each other - that’s why they are lovers. So it sounds super weird.</p><p>I would suggest writing “There was a pair of lovers who decided to get married” and skip the next sentence.</p><p>There’s a few things I didn’t understand:</p><p>What did you mean by “He got rid of several black cats for luck”?</p><p>If the girl was kidnapped without knowing it would happen, how could she leave a letter for her boyfriend? LOL I guess sometimes dreams don’t make sense like that.</p><p>Also, I don’t understand what you were trying to say by “couldn’t get the best of both worlds’? Which two things are you referring to?</p><p>Very few mistakes in general though!</p><blockquote><p>Hi, Christian!</p><p>I said “He got rid of several black cats for luck”, because black cats refer to misfortune in ancient culture. About the letter, I guess the girl might found a method to send the letter to the boy when she arrived “unkown-place”, but she couldn’t left their (I wish she could!). About the two things, one is love, the other is the permission of their parents. I want to share a ancient poetry with you, and hope you like it!</p><p>How long will the full moon appear？</p><p>Wine cup in hand，I ask the sky.</p><p>I do not know what time of the year</p><p>It would be tonight in the palace on high.</p><p>Riding the wind，there I would fly，</p><p>Yet I’m afraid the crystalline palace would be</p><p>Too high and cold for me.</p><p>I rise and dance，with my shadow I play.</p><p>On high as on earth，would it be as gay？</p><p>The moon goes round the mansions red</p><p>Through gauze-draped window soft to shed</p><p>Her light upon the sleepless bed.</p><p>Why then when people part，is the oft full and bright？</p><p>Men have sorrow and joy；they part or meet again；</p><p>The moon is bright or dim and she may wax or wane.</p><p>There has been nothing perfect since the olden days.</p><p>So let us wish that man</p><p>Will live long as he can！</p><p>Though miles apart，we’ll share the beauty she displays.</p></blockquote></blockquote><h3 id="May-6-2021"><a href="#May-6-2021" class="headerlink" title="May 6, 2021"></a>May 6, 2021</h3><p>Windy</p><p>These days, I spent a lot of time learning English, but <u>I usually made mistakes because of my carelessness</u>. I found that there are many differences in grammar between English and Chinese. <u>So I needed to change my way of thinking.</u> I used to write “casual” sentences in Chinese daily beacuse I wanted to write down my actual thinking without too much consideration. But I should pay more attention to grammar, especially the way of the native English speakers think. As my teacher said, <u>language isn’t only a tool to talk with other people, but also the representation of a culture (but also part of the the culture which uses it).</u> I wrote down these sentences, and made sure that they could express my thoughts well when others read them. Therefore, I decided to mark <code>every place</code> where I was not sure, and I hope my kind friends could help me correct my grammar errors.</p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Very good text, Echo! I feel like you put in a little bit more effort and it shows. The grammar you used was more complicated than usual.</p><p>I’m not sure what you meant with “thought of the native English speakers”, so perhaps the way I corrected isn’t what you intended to say?</p><p>Instead of “the representation of a culture”</p><p>you could also say</p><p>“a representation of culture”.</p><p>If you use “the”, it’s a specific representation and hence cannot be any culture but must be a single one, therefore you need to say “a culture in this case”.</p><p>If you only say “a representation” it could be any representation of any culture, so you can drop the article before culture completely.</p><p>Either works, but don’t mix them up.</p><p><u>About behalf, it’s a word that means you do something as a representative.</u></p><p>For example</p><p>“I came here on Tom’s behalf”</p><p>= I came here because Tom wanted me to represent him.</p><p>= I am a representative of Tom.</p><p>But you were talking about a representation, not a representative. Representation has multiple definitions:</p><p>1) a person or organization that speaks, acts, or is present officially for someone else</p><p>or</p><p>2) “the way that someone or something is shown or described”</p><p>1) is the act of being a representative. But you were using the second definition, which doesn’t have anything to do with that. I hope this clears up some confusion.</p><p>Your little comments definitely helped me correct your text. I also think trying to rephrase your own sentences with different words is a good way of practicing your understanding.</p><p>Good job!</p><blockquote><p>My meaning of “thought of the native English speakers” is the same as what you wrote. I will write another dialy to explain it. And I got that “behalf” is used as “representative” (on behalf of sb).

Saying “I got up early to catch the car” sounds kinda strange. Typically, you try to catch the bus or a train because they are scheduled to leave at a certain point.

However, you are sometimes talking about things that already happened, so all of these sentences should be in simple past or present perfect instead.</p><p>You could say “I will restart to write diary entries now” as well, this depends on your perspective. Using the simple present here sounds strange, though.</p><p>It would be best to say “My life has recovered to normal”, because your life is still normal right now. Simple past would work here as well, though (“My life recovered to normal”).</p><p>I put a full stop after “your company helped me come back” because you switched from second person (you) to third person (they). In the first sentence you were adressing your friends directly (“you”) but in the second sentence you talked about them in third person (“they”).

When I first bumped into Oreo in 2017, he was hardly a month old and could barely open his eyes. I found him at the corner of a bazaar and saw him all curled up there, shivering. I decided to take him in and shelter him. Fun fact, I mostly fed him goat’s milk since I ever got him. Oreo is an introverted little fella, just like me. If he likes you and enjoys your company, he will just sit or lay right next to you without making a sound. Oh Oreo, my little buddy, I hope you stay healthy and don’t forget to eat well!</p><p><img src="/posts/51ddcc83/April27,2021.jpg" alt="April27,2021"></p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a><br>Hi Echo! Your text sounds super natural this time around.</p><p>I think “my writing skill is improving” sounds better, because this is a process that takes time. Simple present is not really incorrect, but it definitely sounds unnatural here.</p><p>Be careful because it’s writing, not writting with two “t”s :D</p><p>I tend to correct all if-clauses if I see their tense is not the way it’s strictly supposed to be. In conversation, “If he likes you, he would just […]” would probably slip right by. But technically, the first part is in simple present, so the second one has to be in will-future (conditional type 1). You could also say “If he liked you, he would” but then it would mean Oreo is unlikely to like other people.</p><p>By the way, why did you call him 奥利奥? Do you pronounce these characters like Orio = Oreo?? Or does it have a different meaning?</p><blockquote><p>Hi, Bleischwitz! Thanks for your help! And the word “奥利奥” in Chinese has the same meaning as “Oreo” in English. Because “Oreo”(the cat) is black and white just like “Oreo”(the cookie). And also, these two words’ pronunciation are the same.  : )</p><p>Another question, “If he likes you, he would just […]” doesn’t have problem, right? Because if I change it into “If he liked you, he would just […]” it sounds strange for me.</p></blockquote><p>Wow, so it really means Oreo! I would never have guessed from the characters. I guess the word was made up to sound like Oreo because 奥 and 利 mean completely unrelated things, I think?</p><p>About your question, there is a problem! For this, you should read up on “conditional sentences”. I will try to explain it briefly:</p><p>In your case, there are two ways to form this sentence:</p><p>“If he likes you, he will […]” (first conditional, you think this is realistic)</p><p>or</p><p>“If he liked you, he would […]” (second conditional, you think this is unrealistic/unlikely)</p><p>With these types of sentences, the tenses in both the if-clause (the part of the sentence that starts with if) and the main clause (the other part of the sentences) are set in stone. You don’t change them and you don’t mix them!</p><p>So “If he liked you, he will […]” is not correct.</p><p>I know why it sounds strange to say “If he liked”, because it makes you think it’s in the past. But this “if you liked” is not in the past! It means “If he likes you (right now)”, except you don’t think it’s realistic that will happen.</p><p>When talking about the past, the sentence would be “If he had liked you”.</p></blockquote><h3 id="April-26-2021"><a href="#April-26-2021" class="headerlink" title="April 26, 2021"></a>April 26, 2021</h3><p>Sunny</p><p>I had a tummy stomachache the day before yesterday.

It’s hard to correct for me without knowing, so please let me know. :D</p><p>Technically it’s not incorrect to say “The sun broke through the clouds, and the sun shone down on me.”, but it sounds extremely unnatural.

So in your text, it should say: “We shared our skills with each other, […]”. </p><p>If you only say “We shared our skills and became friends”, I think everyone would understand what you mean from the context.

So instead it’s better to just say “he tried to slow down” or “slowed down his speech for me”.</p><p>I wish you and me both a good day, too! :D</p></blockquote><h3 id="April-22-2021"><a href="#April-22-2021" class="headerlink" title="April 22, 2021"></a>April 22, 2021</h3><p>Light rain</p><p>Yesterday, my friend went to the hospital to be vaccinated, and passed by some houses with gardens. There were so many flowers in the garden that I could not name them. When she went back to the terrace, she mumbled with uncontrollable excitement, “Flowers are blooming! Flowers are blooming!”. </p><p>Last night, I dreamt that I found a big house with four floors. The landlord said it can hold more than ten people. There was a beautiful garden on the second floor, with a shelf containing a lots of lovely decorations. There was a wall of books on the third floor. On the top floor, there was a terrace where everyone could see the sea. Some bluish violet jellyfishes filled the sea.</p><p>A nice dream, wasn’t it?</p><p><img src="/posts/51ddcc83/April22,2021.jpeg" alt="April 22, 2021"></p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://www.italki.com/user/8634802">Cherry</a></p><p>Really lovely!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Hello again Echo :)</p><p>Overall, this was a very good text! You don’t make a lot of mistakes. Your dream sounds very fun. I would tell you about mine, but I already forgot it…</p><p>I also have some comments that might help you. They may be a bit hard to understand, but I hope they will be useful anyway. I wish I could explain in Chinese, but sadly I can’t! :(</p><p>In the first sentence, you need a place or the sentence will sound incorrect. If you say “She went to do X”, a native speaker will ask themselves “Where did she go?”. The sentence sounds incomplete.</p><p>“to have a vaccination” gets the meaning across, but to put this correctly, you need to use the passive. (She was vaccinated = to be vaccinated) </p><p>If you do not know how to use the passive yet, you can also say “She got a vaccination yesterday” (It’s informal speech though). </p><p>“[…] “Flowers are blooming! Flowers are blooming!”, she mumbled with […]” is how to put the verb after the direct speech. In this case, you need a comma (,) and not a full stop (.) . It’s still the same sentence.</p><p>However, you can only say this if you drop the subordinate clause (“When she went back to the terrace,”). With this clause before the rest of the sentence, it sounds very strange if you don’t put the verb before the direct speech.</p><p>When using indirect speech, watch out for auxiliary verbs  must, can, may, etc., because they will change.</p><p>can -&gt; could</p><p>may -&gt; might</p><p>must -&gt; have to</p><p>So: The landlord said “It can hold up to ten people.”</p><p>-&gt; The landlord said it could hold up to ten people.</p><p>Both “containing lots of” and “containing a lot of” are okay, but not “a lots” because lots is plural and doesn’t need an article. “a lot of” is already spoken language, but “lots” is even more informal.</p><p>Since your dream is over now when you tell the story, you should put everything in it in simple past and not simple present. Watch out not to swap between tenses on accident!</p></blockquote><h3 id="April-21-2021"><a href="#April-21-2021" class="headerlink" title="April 21, 2021"></a>April 21, 2021</h3><p>Cloudy to light rain</p><p>I bought a lovely new diary, and I also made a plan to write in my English diary. I’m afraid I have poor English, even though I read some English books and songs. But I want to give it a try. I ate shredded chicken noodles tonight, I love it so much. I wish you could have a taste. I also ordered a milk tea with fruit, but I had to wait for a long time. </p><p><img src="/posts/51ddcc83/April21,2021.png" alt="April 21, 2021"></p><blockquote><p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p><p>Hey again Echo!</p><p>Maybe you were confused here:</p><p>“I’m afraid of my poor English” = I am scared = My English is scary </p><p>(I don’t think your English is scary hahaha)</p><p>“I’m afraid my English is poor” = “I am sorry, but my English is poor” or “I am not happy about it, but my English is poor”</p><p>I think your diary is a very good idea :) I hope you will post regularly!

Are you going to make a salad?<br>那是什么？你要做沙拉吗?<br>W： No, I’m going to make a gazpacho.<br>不是，我要做西班牙冷菜汤。<br>M： What’s that?<br>那是什么?<br>W：Gazpacho is a cold soup from Spain. It’s mostly vegetables.<br>西班牙冷菜汤是一种西班牙冷汤，里面主要是蔬菜。<br>I guess you could call it a liquid salad.<br>我想你可以称之为液体沙拉。<br>M：Cold soup? Sounds weird.<br>冷汤？听起来很奇怪。<br>W：It’s delicious. Trust me. I tried it for the first time during my summer vacation in Spain.<br>很好吃的，相信我，我第一次吃是暑假去西班牙的时候。<br>You see, in the south of Spain, it gets very hot in the summer, up to 40℃.<br>你要知道，夏天的时候，西班牙南部很热的，高达40℃呢。<br>So a cold gazpacho is very refreshing.<br>所以冷菜汤非常消暑。<br>The main ingredients are tomato, cucumber, bell peppers, olive oil and stale bread.<br>里面主要是西红柿、黄瓜、甜椒、橄榄油和干面包。<br>M： Stale bread? Surely you mean bread for dipping into the soup?<br>干面包？你肯定它蘸汤好吃？<br>W： No. Bread is crushed and blended in like everything else.<br>不是这样，把面包压碎混在一起吃。<br>It adds texture and thickness to the soup.<br>它会让汤口感更好，更浓稠。<br>M： Mm.<br>哦，<br>And is it healthy?<br>健康吗？<br>W： Sure. As I said earlier, it’s mostly vegetables.<br>当然健康啦，我之前说过，它以蔬菜为主要原料制作而成。<br>You can also add different things if you like, such as hard-boiled egg or cured ham.<br>如果你喜欢的话，也可以添加各种不同的东西，比如煮熟的鸡蛋或腌火腿。<br>M： Cured ham? What’s that?<br>腌火腿？什么东西？<br>W： That’s another Spanish delicacy. Have you never heard of it? It is quite famous.<br>它也是一种西班牙美食，你没听说过吗？很有名的。<br>M： No. Is it good too?<br>没有，好吃吗？<br>W： Oh, yeah, definitely. It’s amazing. It’s a little dry and salty, and it’s very expensive because<br>当然啦，非常可口，干干的，咸咸的，而且很贵呢，<br>it comes from a special type of pig that only cats a special type of food.<br>因为它取自一种特殊品种的猪，并且这种猪只吃一种特殊的食物。<br>The ham is covered in salt to dry and preserve it, and left to hang for up to two years. It has a very distinct flavor.<br>火腿上撒上了盐，风干保存，然后放上两年，它有一种非常独特的味道。<br>M： Mm. Sounds interesting. Where can I find some?<br>恩，听起来很有趣，我在哪里可以找到这种火腿呢？<br>W： It used to be difficult to get Spanish produce here. But it’s now a lot more common.<br>过去在这儿很难买到西班牙产品，但现在这种火腿很常见。<br>Most large supermarket chains have cured ham in little packets, but in Spain you can buy a whole leg.<br>很多大型连锁超市都是卖的小包装，但在西班牙你可以买到一整只。<br>M： A whole pig leg? Why would anybody want so much ham?<br>一整只？为什么有人会想要这么多？<br>W： In Spain, many people buy a whole leg for special group events, such as Christmas.<br>在西班牙，许多人在集体活动的时候，比如圣诞节，买整只的火腿。<br>They cut it themselves into very thin slices with a long flat knife.<br>他们用一把又长又平的刀把它切成很薄的薄片。<br>Questions 1 to 4 are based on the conversation you have just heard.<br>请根据你听到的对话回答1-4题<br>1.What do we learn about gazpacho?<br>问题1：我们对西班牙冷菜汤了解到什么？<br>2.For what purpose is stale bread mixed into gazpacho?<br>问题2：西班牙冷菜汤里加入干面包是为了什么？<br>3.Why does the woman think gazpacho is healthy?<br>问题3：为什么这位女士认为西班牙冷菜汤是健康的?<br>4.What does the woman say about cured ham?<br>问题4：关于腌火腿，这位女士说了什么?</p><h4 id="解析"><a href="#解析" class="headerlink" title="解析"></a>解析</h4><ol><li><p>A) It is a <u>typical salad</u>.<br>B) It is a <u>Spanish <code>soup</code></u>.<br>C) It is a <u>weird vegetable</u>.<br>D) It is a kind of <u>spicy food</u>.</p><blockquote><p>难度: 易。</p><p>题型: 视听一致。<br>原文:  </p><p>信号词: 无|表达态度 I think, I’m afraid|强调 really, often, any, much too, typically, just simply have to, what matters most, almost,always , need to, so far, all, substantially|转折 but, on the other hand, another, instead|疑问句|数词 second|并列 meanwhile|因果 therefore, as a consequence。</p><p>解析: </p></blockquote></li><li><p>A) To make it <u><code>thicker</code></u>.<br>B) To make it <u>more nutritious</u>.<br>C) To add to its <u>appeal</u>.<br>D) To <u>replace an ingredient</u>.</p><blockquote><p>难度: 易。</p><p>题型: 视听一致。<br>原文:  </p><p>信号词: 无|表达态度 I think, I’m afraid|强调 really, often, any, much too, typically, just simply have to, what matters most, almost,always , need to, so far, all, substantially|转折 but, on the other hand, another, instead|疑问句|数词 second|并列 meanwhile|因果 therefore, as a consequence。</p><p>解析: </p></blockquote></li><li><p>A) It contains very <u>little fat</u>.<br>B) It <u>uses olive oil</u> in cooking.<br>C) It uses <u>no artificial additives</u>.<br>D) It is mainly <u>made of <code>vegetables</code></u>.</p><blockquote><p>难度: 易。</p><p>题型: 视听一致,。<br>原文:  </p><p>信号词: 无|表达态度 I think, I’m afraid|强调 really, often, any, much too, typically, just simply have to, what matters most, almost,always , need to, so far, all, substantially|转折 but, on the other hand, another, instead|疑问句|数词 second|并列 meanwhile|因果 therefore, as a consequence。</p><p>解析: </p></blockquote></li><li><p>A) It does not <u>go stale</u> for two years.<br>B) It takes <u>no special skill</u> to prepare.<br>C) It comes from a <u><code>special</code> kind of <code>pig</code></u>.<br>D) It is a <u>delicacy blended with bread</u>.</p><blockquote><p>难度: 易。</p><p>题型: 视听一致。<br>原文: </p><p>信号词: 无|表达态度 I think, I’m afraid|强调 really, often, any, much too, typically, just simply have to, what matters most, almost,always , need to, so far, all, substantially|转折 but, on the other hand, another, instead|疑问句|数词 second|并列 meanwhile|因果 therefore, as a consequence。</p><p>解析: </p></blockquote></li></ol><h3 id="听力第二篇"><a href="#听力第二篇" class="headerlink" title="听力第二篇"></a>听力第二篇</h3><h4 id="原文-1"><a href="#原文-1" class="headerlink" title="原文"></a>原文</h4><p>M： Hello, I wish to buy a bottle of wine.<br>你好，我想买瓶葡萄酒。<br>W： Hi, yes. What kind of wine would you like?<br>你好，您喜欢什么酒?<br>M： I don’t know. Sorry, I don’t know much about wine.<br>我不知道，对不起，我不太懂酒。<br>W： That’s no problem at all. What’s the occasion and how much would you like to spend?<br>没事的，请问什么场合用，预算是多少?<br>M： It’s for my boss. It’s his birthday. I know he likes wine, but I don’t know what type.<br>这是送给我老板的生日生物，我知道他喜欢喝葡萄酒，但我不知道是哪种。<br>I also do not want anything too expensive, maybe mid-range.<br>不要太贵，中档就行。<br>How much would you say is a mid-range bottle of wine approximately?<br>一瓶中档葡萄酒大约多少钱?<br>W： Well, it varies greatly. Our lowest prices are around $ 6 a bottle,<br>价格有高有低，最便宜的大约6美元一瓶，<br>but those are table wines. They are not very special. And I would not suggest them as a gift.<br>但这些都是普通的佐餐酒，没有什么特别之处，我不建议您买这种葡萄酒送给你的老板，<br>On the other end, our most expensive bottles are over $ 150.<br>我们最昂贵的葡萄酒一瓶超过150美元。<br>If you are looking for something priced in the middle,<br>如果您想选中间价位的，<br>I would say anything between $ 30 and $ 60 would make a decent gift.

Derek Chauvin denies charges of manslaughter and murder. </p><p>大家好，尼尔·努内斯为您播报BBC新闻。在美国明尼阿波利斯市，对被控杀害乔治·弗洛伊德的前警察的第一天审判已经结束，双方都进行了开庭辩论。德里克·肖万否认了过失杀人和谋杀的指控。</p><blockquote><p>manslaughter</p><p>表示“过失杀人”</p><p>英文解释为“the crime of killing sb illegally but not deliberately”</p></blockquote><p>The jury saw a new footage of him kneeling in Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than 9 minutes. The defendants argued that Mr. Floyd’s drug use and poor health led to his death. Here’s our North America editor Jon Sopel.</p><p>陪审团观看了一段他跪在弗洛伊德脖子上超过9分钟的新视频。被告辩称，弗洛伊德的吸毒和健康状况不佳导致了他的死亡。请听本台北美编辑琼恩·索珀的报道。</p><blockquote><p>jury</p><p>表示“陪审团”</p><p>英文解释为“a group of members of the public who listen to the facts of a case in a court and decide whether or not sb is guilty of a crime”</p><p>举个🌰：to serve on a jury 担任陪审员</p><p>图/电影例句：</p><p><img src="/posts/ebf1d287/640-20210410084250743.jpeg" alt="img"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>kneeling in</p><p>单词：kneeling in</p><p>表示“跪在”</p><p>英文解释为“to be in or move into a position where your body is resting on your knees”</p><p>举个🌰：Kneeling down, Tom patted the dog. 汤姆跪着轻轻拍了拍那只狗。</p></blockquote><p>What’s unfolding in a courthouse in Minneapolis is not just about George Floyd and Derek Chauvin in many people’s eyes. This is American justice itself on trial.</p><p>在明尼阿波利斯法院的审判，在许多人看来，不仅仅是乔治·弗洛伊德和德里克·肖万的事。这是美国司法系统对自己的审判。</p><blockquote><p>This is sb justice itself on trail</p><p>表示“这是某人对自己的审判”</p></blockquote><p>America was convulsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests with demonstrations erupting in every city across the land. If Mr. Chauvin walks free, many will draw the conclusion that to the justice system, black lives don’t matter and that could be another dangerous flash point.</p><p>去年，“黑人的命也是命”抗议活动震撼了美国，全国每个城市都爆发了示威活动。如果肖万无罪释放，许多人会得出这样的结论：对于司法系统来说，黑人的生命并不重要，这可能是又一个危险的导火索。</p><blockquote><p>convulse</p><p>表示“撼动”</p><p>英文解释为“if sth such as a war convulse a country, it causes a lot of problems or confusion”</p><p>举个🌰：A wave of nationalist demonstrations convulsed the country in 1919. 1919年，民族主义游行示威震动了该国。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>erupting in every city across the land</p><p>句式：erupting in every city across the land</p><p>表示“爆发在这片土地的每一个城市”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>walk free</p><p>表示“被无罪释放”</p><p>英文解释为“to leave a court of law without being punished or sent to prison”</p><p>举个🌰：Tom walked free after the charges were dropped.撤诉后，汤姆被无罪释放。</p></blockquote><p>The Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has replaced six cabinet ministers in the biggest reshuffle since he came to power just over 2 years ago. The controversial Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo is among those sacked. Will Grant has more. Mr. Araujo repeatedly denied the effects of climate change and was in almost constant conflict with China, a long-standing economic partner. However, his resignation which was widely anticipated, was followed by the unexpected departure of the Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva.</p><p>巴西总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗更换了6名内阁部长，这是他两年前上台以来最大规模的内阁改组。备受争议的外交部长埃内斯托·阿劳霍也被解职。请听威尔·格兰特的报道。阿劳霍曾多次否认气候变化的影响，而且几乎一直与长期的经济伙伴中国发生冲突。他的辞职是在意料之中的，但随后国防部长费尔南多·阿泽维多·席尔瓦的离职出乎人们的意料。</p><blockquote><p>among those sacked</p><p>表示“被解雇的一份子”</p><p>the sack英文解释为“when someone is dismissed from their job”</p><p>举个🌰：They’ve never actually given anyone the sack.他们从未真的辞退过什么人。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>long-standing</p><p>表示“存在已久的”</p><p>英文解释为“that has existed or lasted for a long time”</p><p>举个🌰：a long-standing relationship 长期的关系</p></blockquote><p>That appeared to prompt the wider reshuffle by President Bolsonaro involving at least six ministries in total. Amid the changes, there also rumors in the media of serious rumblings among the top brass in all three branches of the military, stoking the sense of a major crisis in the Bolsonaro administration.</p><p>这似乎促使总统博索纳罗进行更广泛的重组，涉及至少六个部。媒体上也有传言称，军方所有三个部门的高级将领对这些变动议论纷纷，给博索纳罗政府增添了重大的危机感。</p><blockquote><p>rumblings</p><p>表示“传闻”</p><p>英文解释为“remarks that show that people are staring to become annoyed, or that a difficult situation is developing”</p><p>举个🌰：There have been rumblings about the need for better computers.人们一直抱怨说需要更先进的电脑。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>top brass</p><p>表示“要员”</p><p>英文解释为“the people who are in the most important positions in a company, an organization, etc.”</p><p>举个🌰：All the top brass was / were at the ceremony. 所有要员都出席了典礼。 </p></blockquote><blockquote><p>stoke</p><p>单词：stoke</p><p>表示“激起”</p><p>英文解释为“to cause sth to increase”</p><p>举个🌰：Rising oil prices stoked inflation 油价上涨加剧了通货膨胀</p><p>图/电影例句：</p><p><img src="/posts/ebf1d287/640-20210410084250766.jpeg" alt="img"></p></blockquote><p>President Biden has implored US governors and mayors to continue to require people to wear face coverings in public. He said masks were crucial because reckless behavior was causing a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the US.</p><p>拜登总统呼吁美国州长和市长继续要求人们在公共场合戴口罩。他表示，戴口罩至关重要，因为不戴口罩这类鲁莽的行为正在导致美国冠状病毒感染人数上升。</p><blockquote><p>implore</p><p>表示“恳求”</p><p>英文解释为“to ask for sth in an emotional way”</p><p>举个🌰：She implored the soldiers to save her child. 她恳求那些士兵救救她的孩子。</p><p>图/电影例句：</p><p><img src="/posts/ebf1d287/640-20210410084250966.gif" alt="img"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>crucial</p><p>表示“至关重要的”</p><p>英文解释为“externally important, because it will affect other things”</p><p>举个🌰：North Korea claims another ‘crucial test’ conducted at once-dismantled rocket site. 朝鲜声称在曾经废弃的火箭发射地进行了另一个至关重要的测试。</p><p>图/电影例句：</p><p><img src="/posts/ebf1d287/640-20210410084250757.jpeg" alt="img"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>reckless</p><p>表示“无所顾忌的”</p><p>英文解释为“showing a lack of care about danger and the possible results of your actions”</p><p>举个🌰：He had always been reckless with money. 他花钱总是大手大脚。</p><p><img src="/posts/ebf1d287/640-20210410084251651.gif" alt="img"></p></blockquote><p>As I do my part to accelerate the vaccine distribution of vaccinations, I need the American people do their part as well. Mask up！Mask up！It’s a patriotic duty. It’s the only way we ever get back to normal. Mr. Biden made the appeal after the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an emotional warning about the spread of COVID-19.</p><p>我正在努力加快疫苗分发，同时我也需要美国人民做出自己的努力。戴口罩！戴口罩！这是爱国的义务。只有这样我们才能恢复正常。拜登发出上述呼吁之前，美国疾病控制与预防中心主任就新冠肺炎的传播发出了严重的警告。</p><blockquote><p>appeal</p><p>表示“呼吁”</p><p>英文解释为“an urgent and deeply felt request for his money, help or information, especially six made by a charity or by the policy”</p><p>举个🌰：a look for silent appeal 默默恳求的目光</p></blockquote><p>The Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari is traveling to London today for what his office described as a routine medical check.

Mr. Bolsonaro was forced to reshuffle his cabinet on Monday, replacing the Defense and Foreign ministers. Here is our correspondent Will Grant.</p><p>The three men, General Edson Leal Pujol, Admiral Ilques Barbosa and Lieutenant-Brigadier Antonio Carlos Bermudes are furious over the way in which the previous Defense Minister was forced out. In what was believed to have been a fiery and hostile first meeting with his replacement, a Bolsonaro loyalist called Braga Netto, the military chiefs tended their resignations. It all amounts to the biggest political crisis President Bolsonaro has experienced since coming to office. Combined with his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic, the pressure on the right-wing leader has ramped up significantly in recent weeks.</p><p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for the under-60s after the country’s vaccine committee said it had received reports of 31 cases of a rare type of blood clot, among more than 2.7 million people who received the jab. Jenny Hill is in Berlin. Angela Merkel said the decision was about trust, in which she said be wrong to sweep the very rare, but very serious cases under the carpet. Even so, the development presents a problem for the Chancellor who’s under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccination program as case numbers rise. </p><p>Mrs. Merkel acknowledged there would now be public concern around the vaccine, the development which may worry on the governments. The world Health Organization says that the vaccine is safe and the European Medicines Agency, which is still investigating the cases, has insisted that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the very low risks.</p><p>A judge in New York has sentenced the brother of the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez to life in prison for trafficking drugs and possessing machine guns. Our correspondent Nada Twafic has this report. For more than a decade, Tony Hernandez trafficked more than 185 tons of cocaine into the United States by plane, boat and submarine. Some of the illegal drugs were apparently labeled with his initials.</p><p>US attorney said the former congressman used the proceeds in part to influence three presidential elections. His brother Juan Orlando Hernandez established himself as a champion in the fight against drugs, but prosecutors labeled him as a coconspirator who took millions of dollars in bribes from drug lords, including El Chapol. He has not been formally charged in the United States.

Even so, the development presents a problem for the Chancellor who’s under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccination program as case numbers rise. </p><p>德国总理安格拉•默克尔同意暂停为60岁以下人群使用阿斯利康冠状病毒疫苗，此前该国疫苗委员会称270多万注射人群中出现了31例罕见血栓病例报告。请听珍妮•希尔在柏林的报道。安格拉•默克尔表示，这一决定关乎信任，将非常罕见但非常严重的病例掩盖起来是错误的。尽管如此，事态的发展给德国总理带来了问题，随着病例数量的增加，她面临着加速迟缓的疫苗接种计划的压力。</p><blockquote><p>sweep sth under the carpet</p><p>表示“掩盖某些东西”</p><p>carpet英文解释为“a heavy fabric cover for a floor”</p><p>图：</p><p><img src="/posts/f2f27eca/640-20210409091115323.jpeg" alt="img"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>sluggish</p><p>表示“缓慢的”</p><p>英文解释为“moving, reacting or working more slowly than normal and in a way that seems lazy”</p><p>举个🌰：the sluggish black waters of the canal 运河里缓慢流动的黑乎乎的河水。</p><p>图：</p><p><img src="/posts/f2f27eca/640-20210409091115973.gif" alt="img"></p></blockquote><p>Mrs. Merkel acknowledged there would now be public concern around the vaccine, the development which may worry on the governments. The world Health Organization says that the vaccine is safe and the European Medicines Agency, which is still investigating the cases, has insisted that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the very low risks.</p><p>默克尔承认，现在疫苗引起了公众关注，事态发展可能会让政府感到担忧。世界卫生组织表示，该疫苗是安全的，仍在调查病例的欧洲药品管理局坚称，该疫苗的好处远远大于极低的风险。</p><p>A judge in New York has sentenced the brother of the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez to life in prison for trafficking drugs and possessing machine guns. Our correspondent Nada Twafic has this report. For more than a decade, Tony Hernandez trafficked more than 185 tons of cocaine into the United States by plane, boat and submarine. Some of the illegal drugs were apparently labeled with his initials.</p><p>纽约法官判处洪都拉斯总统胡安•奥兰多•埃尔南德斯的兄弟终身监禁，罪名是走私毒品和持枪。请听本台记者娜达•托菲克的报道。十多年来，托尼•埃尔南德斯通过飞机、船只和潜艇向美国走私了185吨以上的违禁物。一些非法毒品上明显印有他名字的首字母。</p><blockquote><p>trafficking</p><p>表示“贩卖”</p><p>trafficking英文解释为“the buying and selling of illegal goods, especially drugs”</p><p>举个🌰：human trafficking 贩卖人口</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>submarine</p><p>表示“潜艇”</p><p>英文解释为“a ship that can travel under water”</p><p>举个🌰：a nuclear submarine 核潜艇</p></blockquote><p>US attorney said the former congressman used the proceeds in part to influence three presidential elections.

The government of Mozambique says Islamist militants who began attacking the town of Palma on Wednesday have killed dozens of people.<br>大家好，我是贾斯汀·格林，欢迎收听BBC新闻。莫桑比克政府表示，伊斯兰极端武装分子周三开始袭击帕尔马镇，已造成数十人死亡。</p><p>Thousands have fled the assault in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. A Defense Department spokesman Omar Saranga denied the military response had been slow.<br>为躲避袭击，数千人已经逃离了北部德尔加多卡波省。莫桑比克国防部发言人奥马尔·萨兰加否认了军方反应迟缓。</p><blockquote><p>Flee<br>表示“迅速离开”，英文解释为“to leave a person or a place very quickly, especially because you are afraid of possible danger”<br>举个例子 ：many are fleeing violence in their homelands 很多移民是为了逃离家乡的暴力冲突。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Assault<br>表示“袭击”，英文解释为“the act of attacking a building, an area, etc.in order to take control of it”<br>举个例子 ：an assault on the capital was launched in the early hours of the morning 凌晨时分向首都发起了攻击。</p></blockquote><p>Here’s our Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga. After days of silence that’s left many Mozambicans anxious, state security forces shed some light on the events unfolding in Palma. Mr. Omar Saranga said at least seven people were killed when their convoy came under fire as they tried to escape from the town.<br>请听本台驻非洲记者凯瑟琳·拜亚鲁汉加的报道。政府数天的沉默让许多莫桑比克人感到焦虑，现在国家安全部队已经披露了帕尔马袭击的一些事实。奥马尔·萨兰加表示，一个车队在逃离该镇的路上遭到袭击，至少7人丧生。</p><blockquote><p>Unfold<br>表示“披露”，英文解释为“to be gradually made known; to gradually make sth known to other people”<br>举个例子 ：she unfolded her tale to us 她向我们倾吐了她的故事。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Convoy<br>表示“车队”，英文解释为“a group of vehicles or ships travelling together, especially when soldiers or their vehicles travel with them for protection”<br>举个例子 ：a convoy of trucks/ lorries/ freighters 被护送的卡车/货船队。</p></blockquote><p>The family of a South African man Adrian Nell confirmed he died in the ambush. There has been criticism of the army’s response to the attack in Palma. Survivors’ talk of having to fend for themselves as they sought safety. New figures show the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in Mexico is 60% higher than previously thought.<br>南非男子阿德里安·内尔的家人证实他在伏击中死亡。军队对帕尔马袭击事件的反应受到了批评。幸存者表示，他们在逃难的路上不得不自己保护自己。新的资料显示，墨西哥新冠肺炎相关死亡人数比之前的资料高出60%。</p><blockquote><p>Ambush<br>表示“伏击”，英文解释为“the act of hiding and waiting for sb and then making a surprise attack on them”<br>举个 ：two soldiers were killed in a terrorist ambush两名士兵遭到恐怖分子伏击而死亡。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Fend for<br>表示“捍卫自己”，英文解释为“argue or speak in defence of ”同义词：defend, support.</p></blockquote><p>320,000 Mexicans are thought to have died with the disease. Our correspondent Will Grant reports. Having failed to produce excess death data for some time, a government report concluded that a little under 300,000 people died from the virus since the pandemic began until mid-February. Combined with those who have since died from the illness, Mexico would be placed above Brazil and only behind the United States in the global list of COVID related deaths, despite having a far smaller population than both countries.<br>有32万墨西哥人死于这种疾病。请听记者威尔·格兰特报道。政府很长时间以来未能提供非正常死亡资料，现在一份政府报告得出的结论是，自疫情开始至2月中旬，死于该病毒的人数略低于30万人。再加上截至现在的死亡人数，墨西哥的新冠病毒相关死亡人数将超过巴西，仅排在美国之后，尽管墨西哥的人口比这两个国家都少得多。</p><p>In part, the difficulty of obtaining a completely clear picture of the problem in Mexico comes from its low rate of testing. It is also believed that given the shortage of ICU beds in many states, a large number of people have died at home.<br>Mexico and Guatemala have announced a joint operation to deploy hundreds of troops and police along their border to prevent migrants from traveling North towards the United States. The authorities say that they are particularly concerned about the growing number of children and teenagers traveling without their parents in migrant caravans.<br>墨西哥新冠肺炎死亡人数不准确的部分原因是该国的检测率很低。其他原因还包括，墨西哥许多州缺乏重症监护病房，很多人死在家里。墨西哥和瓜地马拉宣布了一项联合行动， 在两国边境部署数百名士兵和警察，阻止非法移民向北前往美国。当局表示，他们尤其担心越来越多的儿童和青少年跟随移民车队来到这里。</p><blockquote><p>Deploy<br>表示“部署”，英文解释为“to move soldiers or weapons into a position where they are ready for military action”如：2000 troops were deployed in the area那个地区部署了2000人的部队。</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Migrant caravans<br>这里指“移民车队”，caravan表示“旅行拖车”英文解释为“a vehicle that a car can pull and in which people can live and sleep when they are on holiday”<br>举个例子 ：trailer caravan site 旅行拖车停车场</p></blockquote><p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the country’s regional leaders to abide by a deal to impose tougher coronavirus restrictions as a third wave of infections gathers pace. Damien McGuinness reports.<br>随着第三波新冠病毒感染率上升，德国总理安格拉·默克尔敦促该国的地区领导人遵守一项协议，实施更严格的限制。请听达米安·麦吉尼斯的报道。</p><p>Germany’s regional governments had agreed to an emergency break, meaning more lockdown restrictions if infection rates rise over a certain level. In much of Germany that rise has now happened, but some regional leaders are still not using that emergency break. That’s an infringement of the agreement, Mrs. Merkel said.<br>The Chancellor also criticized pilot schemes in some parts of the country aimed at opening everything up by requiring people to have a negative test on the day.<br>默克尔还批评了该国一些地区的试点计划， 这些计划的目标是解除一切限制，仅需要人们在当天接受病毒阴性测试。</p><blockquote><p>Infringe<br>表示“侵犯/违反”英文解释为“sth that is against a law or someone’s legal rights”<br>举个例子 ：A backup copy of a computer program dose not infringe copyright 计算机程式的备份不侵犯版权。</p></blockquote><p><code>文末福利</code><br><code>谢谢你看到这里鸭</code><br><code>欢迎关注我的公众号和 B站: 杜衡图南</code><br><code>第一时间获取本文精读笔记和听力原声</code></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-3-THE-LETTERS-FROM-NO-ONE"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-3-THE-LETTERS-FROM-NO-ONE" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-3 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE"></a>Harry Potter 1-3 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE</h1><p>The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her <u>crutches</u>.</p><blockquote><p>crutches拐杖</p></blockquote><p>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.</p><p>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.</p><blockquote><p>哈利进入了Stonewall公立高中，而达力进入了Smeltings私立高中。</p></blockquote><p>“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”</p><blockquote><p>toilet 厕所</p></blockquote><p>“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.</p><p>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.</p><blockquote><p>fond: adjective (LIKING) having feelings of affection for someone or something, or having a liking for an activity:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Figg太太自从摔断腿以后就变得和善起来。</p></blockquote><p>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.</p><p>As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.</p><blockquote><p>handsome英俊的</p><p>ribs肋骨</p></blockquote><p>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.</p><blockquote><p>tub 金属盆</p></blockquote><p>“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.</p><p>“Your new school uniform,” she said.</p><p>Harry looked in the bowl again.</p><p>“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”</p><p>“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”</p><p>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.</p><p>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.</p><p>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.</p><p>“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.</p><p>“Make Harry get it.”</p><p>“Get the mail, Harry.”</p><p>“Make Dudley get it.”</p><p>“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”</p><p>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.</p><p>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</p><blockquote><p>twanging鼻音</p></blockquote><p>Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey</p><p>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.</p><blockquote><p>parchment羊皮纸</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>哈利的信件特点是：黄色信封，绿色的墨水，没有贴邮票。</p></blockquote><p>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.</p><blockquote><p>狮子、鹰、獾、蛇代表了四大学院。</p></blockquote><p>“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.</p><p>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.</p><p>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.</p><p>“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny <u>whelk</u> . . .”</p><blockquote><p>whelk: noun [ C ] a soft sea creature, similar to a snail, that lives in a hard shell</p></blockquote><p>“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy <u>parchment</u> as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.</p><blockquote><p>parchment: noun the thin, dried skin of some animals that was used in the past for writing on, or a high-quality paper</p></blockquote><p>“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.</p><p>“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.</p><p>“P-P-Petunia!” he <u>gasped</u>.</p><blockquote><p>gasped: verb to take a short, quick breath through the mouth, especially because of surprise, pain, or shock:</p></blockquote><p>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.</p><p>“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”</p><p>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.</p><p>“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.</p><p>“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”</p><p>“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.</p><blockquote><p>croak: verb If you croak, you speak with a rough voice because you have a sore or dry throat.</p></blockquote><p>Harry didn’t move.</p><p>“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.</p><p>“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.</p><p>“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.</p><blockquote><p>slamming 砰地关上</p></blockquote><p>“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?”</p><blockquote><p>quivering 颤抖的</p></blockquote><p>“Watching — <u>spying</u> — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.</p><blockquote><p>spy: noun [ C ] a person who secretly collects and reports information about the activities of another country or organization</p></blockquote><p>“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want —”</p><p>Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.</p><p>“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .”</p><p>“But —”</p><p>“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d <u>stamp out</u> that dangerous <u>nonsense</u>?”</p><blockquote><p>stamp sth out: to get rid of something that is wrong or harmful</p><p>nonsense: an idea, something said or written, or behavior that is silly or stupid:</p></blockquote><p>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.</p><blockquote><p>在收到给哈利的意外来信后，弗农夫妇都显得格外慌张，他们决定装作没有收到信。弗农在下班以后甚至专门到碗柜来看哈利。</p></blockquote><p>“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had <u>squeezed</u> through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”</p><blockquote><p>squeeze: verb to press something firmly, especially from all sides in order to change its shape, reduce its size, or remove liquid from it.</p></blockquote><p>“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”</p><p>“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”</p><p>“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</p><p>“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”</p><p>“Why?” said Harry.</p><p>“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this <u>stuff</u> upstairs, now.”</p><blockquote><p>stuff: noun a substance, especially when you do not know or say exactly what it is:</p></blockquote><p>The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one <u>trip</u> upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and <u>stared</u> around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air <u>rifle</u>, which was up on a shelf with the end all <u>bent</u> because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.</p><blockquote><p>trip: noun a journey in which you go somewhere, usually for a short time, and come back again</p><p>stare: to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking</p><p>rifle: noun [ C ] a type of gun with a long barrel (= part shaped like a tube), fired from the shoulder and designed to be accurate at long distances</p><p>bend: verb (CURVE) to (cause to) curve.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>达力家有四个房间，一间是给弗农夫妇住的，一间是给来访者住的（通常是给弗农的姐姐玛姬住），一间给达力睡觉，另一间用来放达力房间放不下的玩具。</p></blockquote><p>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, “I don’t want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .”</p><p>Harry <u>sighed</u> and <u>stretched</u> out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.</p><blockquote><p>sigh: verb [ I ] to breathe out slowly and noisily, expressing tiredness, sadness, pleasure, etc.</p><p>stretch: to make your body or your arms and legs straight so that they are as long as possible, in order to exercise the joints (= place where two bones are connected) after you have been in the same place or position for a long time</p></blockquote><p>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.</p><p>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’ ”</p><p>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to <u>wrestle</u> Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.</p><blockquote><p>wrestle: verb [ I or T ] to fight with someone (especially as a sport) by holding them and trying to throw them to the ground:</p></blockquote><p>“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”</p><p>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.</p><blockquote><p>哈利从碗柜搬到了那个最小的房间，信封上的地址也从碗柜改到了那个小房间。非常神奇。</p></blockquote><p>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He <u>stole</u> downstairs without turning on any of the lights.</p><blockquote><p>steal: verb [ I or T ] to take something without the permission or knowledge of the owner and keep it:</p></blockquote><p>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —</p><p>“AAAAARRRGH!”</p><p>Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive!</p><blockquote><p>squashy: adjective soft and easy to crush:</p></blockquote><p>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.</p><p>“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</p><p>Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and <u>nailed</u> up the mail slot.</p><blockquote><p>nail: noun [ C ] a small, thin piece of metal with one pointed end and one flat end that you hit into something with a hammer, especially in order to fasten or join it to something else:</p><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/nail_noun_002_24408.jpg" alt="nail"></p><p>slot: noun [C] (LONG HOLE) a long, narrow hole, especially one for putting coins into or for fitting a separate piece into:</p><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/slot_noun_002_34292.jpg?version=5.0.165" alt="slot"></p></blockquote><p>“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”</p><p>“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”</p><p>“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.</p><p>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.</p><p>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.</p><p>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.</p><p>“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</p><p>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.</p><p>“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread <u>marmalade</u> on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”</p><blockquote><p>marmalade: noun [ U ] a soft substance with a sweet but slightly bitter taste, made by cooking fruit such as oranges with sugar to preserve it. It is eaten on bread, usually for breakfast.</p><p> <img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marmal_noun_002_22469.jpg?version=5.0.165" alt="picture of marmalade"></p></blockquote><p>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one —</p><p>“Out! OUT!”</p><p>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.</p><p>“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”</p><p>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.</p><p>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.</p><p>“Shake ’em off . . . shake ’em off,” he would <u>mutter</u> whenever he did this.</p><blockquote><p>mutter: verb [ I or T ] to speak quietly and in a low voice that is not easy to hear, often when you are worried or complaining about something:</p></blockquote><p>They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.</p><p>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . .</p><p>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.</p><p>“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”</p><p>She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:</p><p>Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth</p><p>Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</p><p>“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.</p><p>“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.</p><blockquote><p>弗农一家因为忍受不了无休止的邮件被迫逃离房子。弗农带着一家人漫无目的的在高速路上奔驰，最后在一家郊区的破旅馆落脚。然而第二天就有近一百封邮件送到旅馆前台。于是，弗农干脆开车带着全家进了森林。</p></blockquote><p>“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.</p><p>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.</p><p>“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”</p><p>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.</p><p>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.</p><p>“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”</p><p>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.</p><p>“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”</p><p>A toothless old man came <u>ambling</u> up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.</p><blockquote><p>amble: verb [ I usually + adv/prep ] to walk in a slow and relaxed way:</p></blockquote><p>“I’ve already got us some <u>rations</u>,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”</p><blockquote><p>rations: plural noun the food given to someone at one time, esp. to soldiers</p></blockquote><p>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.</p><p>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.</p><p>Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.</p><p>“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.</p><p>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.</p><p>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. <u>Spray</u> from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the <u>filthy</u> windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.</p><blockquote><p>spray: noun [U] a mass of very small drops of liquid carried in the air:</p><p>filthy: adjective (DIRTY) extremely or unpleasantly dirty:</p></blockquote><p>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.</p><p>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.</p><p>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</p><p>One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . .</p><p>BOOM.</p><p>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-2-THE-VANISHING-GLASS"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-2-THE-VANISHING-GLASS" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-2 THE VANISHING GLASS"></a>Harry Potter 1-2 THE VANISHING GLASS</h1><h2 id="1-The-vanishing-glass-消失的玻璃"><a href="#1-The-vanishing-glass-消失的玻璃" class="headerlink" title="1 The vanishing glass 消失的玻璃"></a>1 The vanishing glass 消失的玻璃</h2><p>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their <em>nephew(外甥)</em> on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the <em>brass(黄铜)</em> number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that <em>fateful(重大的)</em> news report about the <em>owls(猫头鹰)</em>. Only the photographs on the <em>mantelpiece(火炉)</em> really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large <em>blond(皮肤白皙的)</em> boy riding his first bicycle, on a <em>carousel(旋转木马)</em> at the <em>fair(展览会)</em>, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.</p><p>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her <em>shrill(尖锐的)</em> voice that made the first noise of the day.</p><p>“Up! Get up! Now!”</p><p>Harry woke with a start. His aunt <em>rapped(拍打)</em> on the door again.</p><p>“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the <em>frying pan(煎锅)</em> being put on the <em>stove(火炉)</em>. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.</p><p>His aunt was back outside the door.</p><p>“Are you up yet?” she <em>demanded(要求)</em>.</p><p>“Nearly,” said Harry.</p><p>“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the <em>bacon(熏肉)</em>. And don’t you <em>dare(胆敢)</em> let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”</p><p>Harry <em>groaned(咕哝)</em>.</p><p>“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.</p><p>“Nothing, nothing . . .”</p><p>Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for <em>socks(袜子)</em>. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry <em>was used to(习惯于)</em> spiders, because the <em>cupboard(橱柜)</em> under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.</p><p>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved <em>punching(拳打)</em> somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.</p><p>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark <em>cupboard(橱柜)</em>, but Harry had always been small and <em>skinny(皮包骨的)</em> for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, <em>knobbly(多疙瘩的)</em> knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch <em>tape(胶带)</em> because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</p><blockquote><p>哈利形象: 瘦弱的，膝盖骨突出，黑色头发，绿色眼睛，带圆框眼睛。</p><p>Scotch: 透明胶带的商标名</p></blockquote><p>“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.”</p><p>Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</p><p>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.</p><p>“<em>Comb(梳理)</em> your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.</p><p>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place.</p><p>Harry was <em>frying(油炸)</em> eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and <em>thick(浓密的)</em> blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a <em>wig(假发)</em>.</p><blockquote><p>达力形象: 粉色大脸，蓝色眼睛，短脖子，浓密的金发贴在胖乎乎的脑袋上，哈利觉得像只戴假发的猪。</p></blockquote><p>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.</p><p>“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”</p><p>“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.”</p><p>“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley <em>tantrum(发怒)</em> coming on, began <em>wolfing down(狼吞虎咽)</em> his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.</p><p>Aunt Petunia obviously <em>scented(嗅到了)</em> danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”</p><p>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .”</p><p>“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.</p><p>“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and <em>grabbed(抓住)</em> the nearest <em>parcel(包裹)</em>. “All right then.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon <em>chuckled(轻笑)</em>.</p><p>“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’<em>Atta boy(好小子)</em>, Dudley!” He <em>ruffled(揉)</em> Dudley’s hair.</p><p>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley <em>unwrap(打开)</em> the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold <em>wristwatch(手表)</em> when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.</p><p>“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.</p><p>Dudley’s mouth fell open in <em>horror(惊骇)</em>, but Harry’s heart gave a <em>leap(跳跃)</em>. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to <em>adventure(冒险)</em> parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a <em>mad(疯)</em> old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of <em>cabbage(卷心菜)</em> and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.</p><p>“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking <em>furiously(狂怒的)</em> at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</p><p>“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.</p><p>“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”</p><p>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a <em>slug(鼻涕虫)</em>.</p><p>“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”</p><p>“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.</p><p>“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).</p><p>Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just <em>swallowed(咽下)</em> a lemon.</p><p>“And come back and find the house in <em>ruins(废墟)</em>?” she <em>snarled(咆哮)</em>.</p><p>“I won’t <em>blow up(炸掉)</em> the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.</p><p>“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “. . . and leave him in the car. . . .”</p><p>“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . .”</p><p>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he <em>screwed up his face(哭丧着脸)</em> and <em>wailed(恸哭)</em>, his mother would give him anything he wanted.</p><p>“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him <em>spoil(毁掉)</em> your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.</p><p>“I . . . don’t . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, <em>pretend(假装的)</em> sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.</p><p>Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia <em>frantically(慌张的)</em> — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.</p><blockquote><p>Piers Polkiss，达力的朋友，长着一张老鼠脸</p></blockquote><p>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.</p><p>“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”</p><p>“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly . . .”</p><p>But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.</p><p>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.</p><p>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen <em>scissors(剪刀)</em> and cut his hair so short he was almost <em>bald(秃顶的)</em> except for his <em>bangs(刘海)</em>, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his <em>baggy(松松垮垮的)</em> clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had <em>sheared(修建)</em> it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.</p><p>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a <em>revolting(难看的)</em> old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand <em>puppet(木偶)</em>, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have <em>shrunk(缩水)</em> in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.</p><p>On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the <em>chimney(烟囱)</em>. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s <em>headmistress(女校长)</em> telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.</p><p>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.</p><p>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.</p><p>“. . . roaring along like <em>maniacs(疯子)</em>, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</p><p>“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”</p><p>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</p><blockquote><p>hoodlums /‘hudləm/ 流氓</p><p>gigantic /dʒaɪ’ɡæntɪk/ 巨大的</p><p>beet 甜菜</p><p>mustache 胡子</p></blockquote><p>“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”</p><p>But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.</p><h2 id="2-At-the-zoo-with-Dudley-动物园之旅"><a href="#2-At-the-zoo-with-Dudley-动物园之旅" class="headerlink" title="2 At the zoo with Dudley 动物园之旅"></a>2 At the zoo with Dudley 动物园之旅</h2><p>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.</p><blockquote><p>van n. 货车, 篷车, 先锋, 前驱, 前卫</p><p>licking /‘likiŋ/ n. 舔, 挫折, 鞭打</p><p>gorilla 大猩猩</p><p>scratching 挠</p><p>remarkably 非常地</p><p>blond adj. 金发的</p></blockquote><p>Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.</p><blockquote><p>tantrum /‘tæntrəm/ 发怒</p><p>knickerbocker glory /‘nɪkɚ,bɑkɚ ‘ɡlɔri/ 冰淇淋圣代</p></blockquote><p>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.</p><p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p><blockquote><p>lit light的过去式和过去分词</p><p>reptile 爬行动物</p><p>lizards 蜥蜴</p><p>crawling 爬行</p><p>slithering 滑行</p><p>poisonous /‘pɔɪzənəs/ 有毒的</p><p>cobra /‘kobrə/ n. 眼镜蛇</p></blockquote><p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.</p><blockquote><p>glistening 发光的</p><p>coil /kɔɪl/ n. 卷；线圈</p></blockquote><p>“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.</p><blockquote><p>whined 发牢骚</p></blockquote><p>“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.</p><blockquote><p>knuckles 指关节</p></blockquote><p>“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p><blockquote><p>moaned 抱怨</p><p>shuffle /‘ʃʌfl/ <em>vi.</em> 拖着脚走</p></blockquote><p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p><blockquote><p>intently 专心的</p><p>boredom 厌倦</p></blockquote><p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.</p><blockquote><p>beady /‘bidi/ 起泡的</p></blockquote><p>It winked.</p><p>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p><blockquote><p>winked 眨眼</p><p>stared 凝视</p></blockquote><p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:</p><blockquote><p>jerk /dʒɝk/ vt. 猛拉</p><p>ceiling n. 天花板</p><p>plainly 直率的</p></blockquote><p>“I get that all the time.”</p><p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”</p><p>The snake nodded vigorously.</p><blockquote><p>vigorously /‘vɪgərəsli/ 活泼的</p></blockquote><p>“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.</p><p>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.</p><blockquote><p>jabbed 戳</p><p>tail 尾巴</p><p>peer vi. 凝视，盯着看；窥视</p></blockquote><p>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.</p><p>“Was it nice there?”</p><p>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p><blockquote><p>specimen 样本</p></blockquote><p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”</p><blockquote><p>deafening 震耳欲聋的</p></blockquote><p>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.</p><p>“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.</p><blockquote><p>ribs 肋骨</p><p>concrete 混凝土</p></blockquote><p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.</p><blockquote><p>gasped 喘息</p></blockquote><p>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have <u>sworn</u> a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, <u>amigo</u>.”</p><blockquote><p>swear: to promise or say firmly that you are telling the truth or that you will do something or behave in a particular way</p><p>amigo: a friend; used especially by or of a Spanish-speaking person</p></blockquote><p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.</p><p>“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”</p><p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he <u>collapsed</u> into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large <u>brandy</u>.</p><blockquote><p>collapse: to fall down suddenly because of pressure or having no strength or support</p><p>brandy: a strong alcoholic drink made from wine and sometimes flavored with fruits</p></blockquote><p>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.</p><p>He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten <u>miserable</u> years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.</p><blockquote><p>miserable: very unhappy:</p></blockquote><p>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown <u>relation</u> coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a <u>violet</u> top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry <u>furiously</u> if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A <u>bald</u> man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to <u>vanish</u> the second Harry tried to get a closer look.</p><blockquote><p>relation: noun [C] (FAMILY MEMBER)  a member of your family.</p><p>violet: noun [C] (PLANT) a small plant with pleasant-smelling purple, blue, or white flowers</p><p>violin: noun [C] a wooden musical instrument with four strings that is held against the neck and played by moving a bow across the strings</p><p>furiously: adverb (ANGRY WAY)</p><p>bald: adjective (NO HAIR) with little or no hair on the head</p><p>vanish: to disappear or stop being present or existing, especially in a sudden, surprising way:</p></blockquote><p>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s <u>gang</u> hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.</p><blockquote><p>gang: noun [ C, + sing/pl verb ] a group of young people, especially young men, who spend time together, often fighting with other groups and behaving badly:</p></blockquote>]]></content>
