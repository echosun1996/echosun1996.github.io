title="FORWORD"></a>FORWORD</h2><p>To Leon Werth</p><p>I ask the <u>indulgence</u> of the children who may read this book for <u>dedicating</u> it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children– although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p><p>To Leon Werth</p><p>when he was a little boy</p><blockquote><ul><li>indulgence /ɪnˈdʌl.dʒəns/: <em>noun</em> an occasion when you allow someone or yourself to have something enjoyable, especially more than is good for you:<br>Chocolate is my only indulgence.<br>All the pleasures and indulgences of the weekend are over, and I must get down to some serious hard work.<br>His health suffered from over-indulgence in (= too much) rich food and drink.</li><li>dedicate /ˈded.ə.keɪt/: <em>verb (GIVE TIME/ENERGY)</em> to give all of your energy, time, etc.:<br>He has dedicated his life to scientific research.<br>The new president said she would dedicate herself to protecting the rights of the sick and the homeless.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h2><p>- we are introduced to the <u>narrator</u>, a pilot, and his ideas about grown-ups</p><blockquote><ul><li>narrator /ˈner.eɪ.t̬ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the character who tells you what is happening in a book or movie</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="1-1-当个画家"><a href="#1-1-当个画家" class="headerlink" title="1-1 当个画家"></a>1-1 当个画家</h3><p>Once when I was six years old I saw a <u>magnificent</u> picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the <u>primeval</u> forest. It was a picture of a <u>boa constrictor</u> in the act of <u>swallowing</u> an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>magnificent /mæɡˈnɪf.ə.sənt/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very good, beautiful, or deserving to be admired:<br>a magnificent view<br>a magnificent piece of writing<br>They live in a magnificent Tudor house.</li><li><strong>primeval /praɪˈmiː.vəl/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> ancient; existing at or from a very early time:<br>primeval forests</li><li><strong>bo‧a /ˈbəʊə $ ˈboʊə/ constrictor /kənˈstrɪk.tɚ/</strong>: <em>noun</em> a large snake that is not poisonous, but kills animals by crushing them</li><li><strong>swal‧low /ˈswɒləʊ $ ˈswɑːloʊ/ :</strong> <em>verb</em> FOOD [intransitive, transitive] to make food or drink go down your throat and towards your stomach<br>He swallowed the last of his coffee and asked for the bill.<br> Most snakes swallow their prey whole.</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285407432035.jpg" alt="《小王子》图片 ---- 一条蟒蛇正在吞食一只大野兽"></p><p>In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without <u>chewing</u> it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for <u>digestion</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li><p><strong>chew /tʃuː/</strong> : <em>verb</em> [intransitive, transitive] to bite food several times before swallowing it<br>This meat’s so tough I can hardly chew it!<br>chew at/on<br> a dog chewing on a bone</p></li><li><p><strong>di‧ges‧tion /daɪˈdʒestʃən, də-/</strong> : <em>noun</em> [uncountable] the process of digesting food</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I <u>pondered</u> deeply, then, over the <u>adventures</u> of the <u>jungle</u>. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ponder /ˈpɑːn.dɚ/</strong>: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to think carefully about something, especially for a noticeable length of time:<br>She sat back for a minute to ponder her next move in the game.</li><li><strong>ad‧ven‧ture /ədˈventʃə $ -ər/</strong> : <em>noun</em> an exciting experience in which dangerous or unusual things happen<br>a great adventure<br> Ahab’s adventures at sea<br> an adventure story</li><li><strong>jun‧gle /ˈdʒʌŋɡəl/</strong> : <em>noun</em> [countable, uncountable] a thick tropical forest with many large plants growing very close together<br>the Amazon jungle</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285507432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第一号作品"></p><p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p><p>But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?”</p><p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285607432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第二号作品"></p><p>The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, <u>arithmetic</u> and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.</p><blockquote><ul><li>a‧rith‧me‧tic /əˈrɪθmətɪk/ : <em>noun</em> the science of numbers involving adding, multiplying etc → mathematics</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="1-2-通情达理之人"><a href="#1-2-通情达理之人" class="headerlink" title="1-2 通情达理之人"></a>1-2 通情达理之人</h3><p>I had been <u>disheartened</u> by the <u>failure</u> of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.

I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:</p><p>“That is a hat.”</p><p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or <u>primeval</u> forests, or stars.

Something was broken in my <u>engine</u>. And as I had with me neither a <u>mechanic</u> nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.

I was more isolated than a <u>shipwrecked</u> <u>sailor</u> on a <u>raft</u> in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can <u>imagine</u> my amazement, at sunrise, when I was <u>awakened</u> by an <u>odd</u> little voice.

I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great <u>seriousness</u>. Here you may see the best <u>portrait</u> that, later, I was able to make of him.

Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>stray /streɪ/</strong>: <em>verb</em> to move away from the place you should be<br>stray into/onto/from<br> Three of the soldiers strayed into enemy territory.</li><li><strong>faint /feɪnt/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> to suddenly become unconscious for a short time <strong>SYN:</strong> pass out<br>Several fans fainted in the blazing heat.</li><li>fatigue /fəˈtiːɡ/: <em>noun (TIREDNESS/WEAKNESS)</em> extreme tiredness:<br>She was suffering from fatigue.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“But– what are you doing here?”</p><p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: “If you please– draw me a sheep…”</p><p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:</p><p>“That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep…”</p><p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,</p><p>“No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very <u>cumbersome</u>. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”</p><p>So then I made a drawing.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285807432035.jpg" alt="这只羊已经病得很重了。"></p><h3 id="2-3-结识小王子"><a href="#2-3-结识小王子" class="headerlink" title="2-3 结识小王子"></a>2-3 结识小王子</h3><p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p><p>“No. This sheep is already very <u>sickly</u>.

I want a sheep that will live a long time.”</p><p>By this time my <u>patience</u> was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart.

It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p><p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p><p>“What is that object?”</p><p>“That is not an object.

I knew very well that in addition to the great planets– such as the Earth, <u>Jupiter</u>, <u>Mars</u>, <u>Venus</u>– to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number.

They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>es‧sen‧tial /ɪˈsenʃəl/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> extremely important and necessary<br>essential for/to<br>A good diet is essential for everyone.<br>it is essential (that)<br>It is essential that our pilots be given the best possible training.<br>it is essential to do something<br>It is essential to book in advance.<br>Window locks are fairly cheap and absolutely essential.<br>Even in small companies, computers are an essential tool.</li></ul></blockquote><p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of <u>rosy</u> <u>brick</u>, with <u>geraniums</u> in the windows and <u>doves</u> on the <u>roof</u>,” they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.

If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.” And what good would it do to tell them that? They would <u>shrug</u> their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: “The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,” then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>shrug /ʃrʌɡ/</strong>: <em>verb</em> (shrugged, shrugging) to raise and then lower your shoulders in order to show that you do not know something or do not care about something<br>I just shrugged my shoulders and ignored him.<br>Melanie shrugged and walked away.</li></ul></blockquote><p>They are like that.

I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the <u>fairy-tales</u>. I should have like to say: “Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep…”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ˈfairy tale</strong>: <em>noun</em> a children’s story in which magical things happen</li></ul></blockquote><p>To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.</p><p>For I do not want any one to read my book carelessly.

And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures…</p><p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no <u>resemblance</u> to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince’s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I <u>fumble</u> along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧sem‧blance /rɪˈzembləns/</strong>: <em>noun</em> if there is a resemblance between two people or things, they are similar, especially in the way they look → similarity<br>resemblance between<br>The resemblance between Susan and her sister was remarkable.<br>bear a (close/striking/uncanny etc) resemblance to somebody/something (=look like)<br>Tina bears a striking resemblance to her mother.<br>bear little/no resemblance to somebody/something<br>What happens in the film bears little resemblance to what actually happened.</li><li><strong>fum‧ble /ˈfʌmbəl/</strong>: <em>verb</em> (also fumble around) [intransitive, transitive] to try to hold, move, or find something with your hands in an awkward way<br>fumble at/in/with<br>She dressed, her cold fingers fumbling with the buttons.<br>fumble for<br>I fumbled around in my bag for a cigarette.<br>She reached round to fumble the light on.</li></ul></blockquote><p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.</p><h2 id="Chapter-5"><a href="#Chapter-5" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 5"></a>Chapter 5</h2><p>- we are warned as to the dangers of the baobabs</p><h3 id="5-1-猴面包树"><a href="#5-1-猴面包树" class="headerlink" title="5-1 猴面包树"></a>5-1 猴面包树</h3><p>As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince’s planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts. It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the <u>catastrophe</u> of the <u>baobabs</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ca‧tas‧tro‧phe /kəˈtæstrəfi/</strong>: <em>noun</em> [countable, uncountable] a terrible event in which there is a lot of destruction, suffering, or death <strong>SYN:</strong> disaster<br>environmental/nuclear/economic etc catastrophe<br> The Black Sea is facing ecological catastrophe as a result of pollution.<br>prevent/avert a catastrophe<br> Sudan requires food immediately to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</li><li><strong>baobabs/‘beɪə(ʊ)bæb/:</strong> n.(非洲)猴面包树</li></ul></blockquote><p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it.

I am glad!”</p><p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:</p><p>“Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?”</p><p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole <u>herd</u> of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>herd /hɜːd $ hɜːrd/</strong>: <em>noun</em> [countable] a group of animals of one kind that live and feed together → flock<br>herd of<br>a herd of cattle<br>herds of elephants</li></ul></blockquote><p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p><p>“We would have to put them one on top of the other,” he said.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282007402033.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>But he made a wise comment:</p><p>“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.”</p><p>“That is strictly correct,” I said. “But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?”</p><p>He answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!”, as if he were speaking of something that was <u>self-evident.</u> And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any <u>assistance</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ˌself-ˈevident</strong>: <em>adjective</em> clearly true and needing no more proof <strong>SYN:</strong> obvious<br>self-evident truths<br> it is self-evident (that)<br>It is self-evident that childhood experiences influence our adult behaviour.</li><li><strong>as‧sist‧ance /əˈsɪstəns/</strong>: <em>noun</em> help or support<br>We offer financial assistance to students.<br>Can I be of any assistance (=can I help you)?<br> with the assistance of somebody/something<br>We’ve rebuilt the theatre with the assistance of the National Lottery.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 id="5-2-小嫩苗"><a href="#5-2-小嫩苗" class="headerlink" title="5-2 小嫩苗"></a>5-2 小嫩苗</h3><p>Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived– as on all planets– good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants. But seeds are invisible. They sleep deep in the heart of the earth’s darkness, until some one among them <u>is seized with the desire to</u> awaken. Then this little seed will <u>stretch</u> itself and begin– <u>timidly</u> at first– to push a charming little <u>sprig</u> <u>inoffensively</u> upward toward the sun. If it is only a <u>sprout</u> of <u>radish</u> or the sprig of a <u>rose</u>-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish. But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>be seized with/by terror/desire etc</strong>: to suddenly be affected by an extremely strong feeling<br>When she saw his face, she was seized by fear.</li><li><strong>stretch /stretʃ/</strong>: <em>verb</em> BODY [intransitive, transitive] to straighten your arms, legs, or body to full length<br> Carl sat up in bed, yawned, and stretched.<br> Always stretch before exercising.</li><li><strong>tim‧id /ˈtɪmɪd/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> not having courage or confidence <strong>SYN:</strong> shy <strong>OPP:</strong> confident<br> I was a timid child.<br> a policy that is both timid and inadequate</li><li><strong>sprig /sprɪɡ/</strong>: <em>noun</em> a small stem or part of a branch with leaves or flowers on it<br> sprig of<br> a sprig of parsley</li><li><strong>in‧of‧fen‧sive /ˌɪnəˈfensɪv◂/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> unlikely to offend or upset anyone<br> Her husband was a small, inoffensive-looking man.</li><li><strong>sprout /spraʊt/</strong>: <em>verb</em> a new growth on a plant <strong>SYN:</strong> shoot</li><li><strong>rad‧ish /ˈrædɪʃ/</strong>: <em>noun</em> a small vegetable whose red or white root is eaten raw and has a strong spicy taste</li><li><strong>rose /rəʊz $ roʊz/</strong>: <em>noun</em><br> FLOWER [countable] a flower that often has a pleasant smell, and is usually red, pink, white, or yellow, or the bush that this flower grows on<br> a dozen red roses<br> A large bouquet of roses arrived on her desk.<br> rose bushes</li></ul></blockquote><p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was <u>infested</u> with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It <u>spreads</u> over the entire planet. It <u>bores</u> clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces…</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>in‧fest /ɪnˈfest/</strong>: <em>verb</em> if insects, rats etc infest a place, there are a lot of them and they usually cause damage<br>be infested with something<br>The kitchen was infested with cockroaches.<br>shark-infested/rat-infested etc<br>shark-infested waters</li><li><strong>spread /spred/</strong>: <em>verb</em> (past tense and past participle spread) AFFECT MORE PEOPLE/PLACES [intransitive, transitive] if something spreads or is spread, it becomes larger or moves so that it affects more people or a larger area<br>spread through<br> Fire quickly spread through the building.<br>spread over<br> He watched the dark stain spread over the gray carpet.<br>spread among<br> The disease spread rapidly amongst the poor.<br>spread (from something) to something<br> The cancer had spread to her liver.<br> Revolution quickly spread from France to Italy.</li><li><strong>bore /bɔː $ bɔːr/</strong>: <em>verb</em> [intransitive, transitive] to make a deep round hole in a hard surface<br>bore something through/into/in something<br> The machine bores a hole through the cards.<br>bore through/into<br> To build the tunnel they had to bore through solid rock.</li></ul></blockquote><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282307402033.jpg" alt="《小王子》中的猴面包树"></p><p>“It is a question of discipline,” the little prince said to me later on. “When you’ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they <u>resemble</u> so closely in their earliest <u>youth</u>.

That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day. Sometimes,” he added, “there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day. But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a <u>catastrophe</u>. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes…”</p><p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a <u>moralist</u>. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my <u>reserve</u>. “Children,” I say <u>plainly</u>, “watch out for the baobabs!”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ought to /ˈɔːt tuː $ ˈɒːt-/</strong>: <em>modal verb</em> used to say that someone should do something because it is the best or most sensible thing to do <strong>SYN:</strong> should<br>You really ought to quit smoking.<br>The company ought to be making changes in its marketing strategy.<br>What sort of crimes ought the police to concentrate on?<br>You were out enjoying yourself when you ought to have been studying.</li><li><strong>mor‧al‧ist /ˈmɒrəlɪst $ ˈmɔː-/</strong>: <em>noun</em> someone who has very strong beliefs about what is right and wrong and how people should behave – used to show disapproval<br>a narrow-minded moralist</li><li><strong>ca‧tas‧tro‧phe /kəˈtæstrəfi/</strong>: <em>noun</em> [countable, uncountable] a terrible event in which there is a lot of destruction, suffering, or death <strong>SYN:</strong> disaster<br>environmental/nuclear/economic etc catastrophe<br>The Black Sea is facing ecological catastrophe as a result of pollution.<br> prevent/avert a catastrophe<br>Sudan requires food immediately to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.</li><li><strong>re‧serve /rɪˈzɜːv $ -ɜːrv/</strong>: <em>noun</em> SUPPLY [countable usually plural] a supply of something kept to be used if it is needed<br>$10 million in cash reserves<br>oil reserves<br> reserve of<br>Somehow Debbie maintained an inner reserve of strength.</li><li><strong>plain‧ly /ˈpleɪnli/</strong>: <em>adverb</em> in a way that is easy to understand or recognize<br>Mrs Gorman was plainly delighted.<br>The first part of that argument is plainly true.<br>We could hear Tom’s voice plainly over the noise of the crowd.<br> [sentence adverb]<br>Plainly the laws are not effective.</li></ul></blockquote><p>My friends, like myself, have been <u>skirting</u> this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>skirt /skɜːt $ skɜːrt/</strong>: <em>verb</em> to avoid talking about an important subject, especially because it is difficult or embarrassing – used to show disapproval<br>a disappointing speech that skirted around all the main issues</li></ul></blockquote><p>Perhaps you will ask me, “Why are there no other drawing in this book as <u>magnificent</u> and <u>impressive</u> as this drawing of the baobabs?”</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>mag‧nif‧i‧cent /mæɡˈnɪfəsənt/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very good or beautiful, and very impressive<br>a magnificent performance<br>The twelve-mile coastline has magnificent scenery.<br>She looked magnificent in a long red dress.</li><li><strong>im‧pres‧sive /ɪmˈpresɪv/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> something that is impressive makes you admire it because it is very good, large, important etc<br>The figures certainly look impressive.<br>Among the guests was an impressive array of authors and critics.</li></ul></blockquote><p>The reply is simple. I have tried. But with the others I have not been successful. When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the <u>inspiring</u> force of <u>urgent</u> <u>necessity</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>in‧spir‧ing /ɪnˈspaɪərɪŋ $ -ˈspaɪr-/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> giving people a feeling of excitement and a desire to do something great <strong>OPP:</strong> uninspiring<br>inspiring music<br>King was a great orator and an inspiring leader.</li><li><strong>ur‧gent /ˈɜːdʒənt $ ˈɜːr-/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very important and needing to be dealt with immediately<br> He was in urgent need of medical attention.<br> The report called for urgent action to reduce lead in petrol.<br> an urgent message</li><li><strong>ne‧ces‧si‧ty /nəˈsesəti/</strong>: <em>noun</em> (plural necessities) [countable] something that you need to have in order to live <strong>OPP:</strong> luxury<br> She saw books as a necessity, not a luxury.<br> A car is an absolute necessity if you live in the country.<br> the basic/bare necessities<br> A lot of families cannot even afford to buy the basic necessities of life.</li></ul></blockquote><h2 id="Chapter-6"><a href="#Chapter-6" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 6"></a>Chapter 6</h2><p>- the little prince and the narrator talk about sunsets</p><h3 id="6-1-看日落"><a href="#6-1-看日落" class="headerlink" title="6-1 看日落"></a>6-1 看日落</h3><p>Oh, little prince! <u>Bit by bit</u> I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life… For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset.

At that moment I was very busy trying to <u>unscrew</u> a <u>bolt</u> that had <u>got stuck in</u> my engine.

Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>re‧sent‧ful /rɪˈzentfəl/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> feeling angry and upset about something that you think is unfair <strong>SYN:</strong> bitter<br>resentful of/about/at etc<br>She felt resentful at not being promoted.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I don’t believe you!

At that instant I was saying to myself: “If this bolt still won’t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.” Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>ham‧mer /ˈhæmə $ -ər/</strong>: <em>noun</em><br>TOOL<br>a) a tool with a heavy metal part on a long handle, used for hitting nails into wood<br>b) a tool like this with a wooden head used to make something flat, make a noise etc<br>an auctioneer’s hammer</li></ul></blockquote><p>“And you actually believe that the flowers–”</p><p>“Oh, no!” I cried. “No, no no!

He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p><p>“I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of consequence!’ And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man– he is a mushroom!”</p><p>“A what?”</p><p>“A mushroom!”</p><p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282107402033.jpg" alt="童话小说《小王子》 "></p><p>“The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I know– I, myself– one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing– Oh! You think that is not important!”</p><h3 id="7-3-独一无二的一株花"><a href="#7-3-独一无二的一株花" class="headerlink" title="7-3 独一无二的一株花"></a>7-3 独一无二的一株花</h3><p>His face turned from white to red as he continued:</p><p>“If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars.

I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:</p><p>“The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a <u>muzzle</u> for your sheep. I will draw you a <u>railing</u> to put around your flower.

On the little prince’s planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p><p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge <u>bud</u>, felt at once that some sort of <u>miraculous</u> apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green <u>chamber</u>. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her <u>petals</u> one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all <u>rumpled</u>, like the field <u>poppies</u>. It was only in the full <u>radiance</u> of her beauty that she wished to appear.</p><blockquote><ul><li><strong>bud /bʌd/</strong>: <em>noun</em> a young tightly rolled-up flower or leaf before it opens<br>rose buds<br>in bud (=having buds but no flowers yet)<br>come into bud (=start to produce buds)</li><li><strong>mi‧rac‧u‧lous /mɪˈrækjələs/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very good, completely unexpected, and often very lucky<br>She made a miraculous recovery from her injuries.<br>They had a miraculous escape when their car plunged into a river.</li><li><strong>ap‧pa‧ri‧tion /ˌæpəˈrɪʃən/</strong>: <em>noun</em> something that you imagine you can see, especially the spirit of a dead person<br>He stared at the strange apparition before him.<br>a ghostly apparition of a man</li><li><strong>cham‧ber /ˈtʃeɪmbə $ -ər/</strong>: <em>noun</em> ENCLOSED SPACE [countable] an enclosed space, especially in your body or inside a machine<br>a combustion chamber<br>The heart has four chambers.</li><li><strong>pet‧al /ˈpetl/</strong>: <em>noun</em> one of the coloured parts of a flower that are shaped like leaves<br>rose petals<br>The flower has seven petals.</li><li><strong>rum‧ple /ˈrʌmpəl/</strong>: <em>verb</em> to make hair, clothes etc less tidy<br>He rumpled her hair playfully.</li><li><strong>pop‧py /ˈpɒpi $ -ˈpɑː-/</strong>: <em>noun</em> (plural poppies) a plant that has brightly coloured, usually red, flowers and small black seeds</li><li><strong>ra‧di‧ance /ˈreɪdiəns/</strong>: <em>noun</em> great happiness that shows in someone’s face and makes them look attractive<br> a young face full of radiance</li></ul></blockquote><p>Oh, yes!

The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house.

When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower. When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep. That is a beautiful occupation. And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.”</p><p>When he arrived on the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.</p><p>“Good morning.

In the old days it was reasonable. I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.”</p><p>“And the orders have been changed since that time?”</p><p>“The orders have not been changed,” said the lamplighter. “That is the tragedy! From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed!”</p><p>“Then what?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Then– the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for <u>repose</u>.

It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.</p><p>“Your planet is very beautiful,” he said. “Has it any oceans?”</p><p>“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.</p><p>“Ah!” The little prince was disappointed. “Has it any mountains?”</p><p>“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.</p><p>“And towns, and rivers, and deserts?”</p><p>“I couldn’t tell you that, either.”</p><p>“But you are a geographer!”</p><p>“Exactly,” the geographer said. “But I am not an explorer. I haven’t a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go <u>loafing</u> about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study.</p><h3 id="15-2-你是探察家"><a href="#15-2-你是探察家" class="headerlink" title="15-2 你是探察家"></a>15-2 你是探察家</h3><p>He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.”</p><p>“Why is that?”</p><p>“Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.”</p><p>“Why is that?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Because <u>intoxicated</u> men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.”</p><p>“I know some one,” said the little prince, “who would make a bad explorer.”</p><p>“That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.”</p><p>“One goes to see it?”</p><p>“No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to <u>furnish</u> proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.”</p><p>The geographer was suddenly <u>stirred</u> to <u>excitement</u>.</p><p>“But you– you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!”</p><p>And, having opened his big <u>register</u>, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The <u>recitals</u> of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.</p><p>“Well?” said the geographer <u>expectantly</u>.</p><p>“Oh, where I live,” said the little prince, “it is not very interesting.

Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct.

The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!”</p><p>“We do not record them,” said the geographer, “because they are <u>ephemeral</u>.”</p><p>“What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p><p>“Geographies,” said the geographer, “are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean <u>empties</u> itself of its waters. We write of <u>eternal</u> things.”</p><p>“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,” the little prince interrupted. “What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p><p>“Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,” said the geographer. “The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.”</p><p>“But what does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.</p><p>“It means, ‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.’”</p><p>“Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?”</p><p>“Certainly it is.”</p><p>“My flower is ephemeral,” the little prince said to himself, “and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!”</p><p>That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.</p><p>“What place would you advise me to visit now?” he asked.</p><p>“The planet Earth,” replied the geographer. “It has a good reputation.”</p><p>And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.</p><h2 id="Chapter-16"><a href="#Chapter-16" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 16"></a>Chapter 16</h2><p>- the narrator discusses the Earth’s lamplighters</p><h3 id="16-1地球上的国王"><a href="#16-1地球上的国王" class="headerlink" title="16-1地球上的国王"></a>16-1地球上的国王</h3><p>So then the seventh planet was the Earth.</p><p>The Earth is not just an ordinary planet!

Next, the lamplighters of China and <u>Siberia</u> would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the <u>wings</u>. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America.

Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide.

They repeat whatever one says to them… On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak…”</p><h2 id="Chapter-20"><a href="#Chapter-20" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 20"></a>Chapter 20</h2><p>- the little prince discovers a garden of roses</p><h3 id="20-1-独一无二的花"><a href="#20-1-独一无二的花" class="headerlink" title="20-1 独一无二的花"></a>20-1 独一无二的花</h3><p>But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the <u>abodes</u> of men.</p><p>“Good morning,” he said.</p><p>He was standing before a garden, all <u>abloom</u> with roses.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284507402039.jpg" alt="小王子和玫瑰花"></p><p>“Good morning,” said the roses.</p><p>The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.</p><p>“Who are you?” he demanded, <u>thunderstruck</u>.</p><p>“We are roses,” the roses said.</p><p>And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!</p><p>“She would be very much annoyed,” he said to himself, “if she should see that… she would cough most <u>dreadfully</u>, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life– for if I did not do that, to <u>humble</u> myself also, she would really allow herself to die…”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284707402039.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>Then he went on with his <u>reflections</u>: “I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees– and one of them perhaps extinct forever… that doesn’t make me a very great prince…”</p><p>And he lay down in the grass and cried.</p><h2 id="Chapter-21"><a href="#Chapter-21" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 21"></a>Chapter 21</h2><p>- the little prince befriends the fox</p><h3 id="21-1-驯服与被驯服"><a href="#21-1-驯服与被驯服" class="headerlink" title="21-1 驯服与被驯服"></a>21-1 驯服与被驯服</h3><p>It was then that the fox appeared.</p><p>“Good morning,” said the fox.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283707402038.jpg" alt="小王子和狐狸"></p><p>“Good morning,” the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.</p><p>“I am right here,” the voice said, “under the apple tree.”</p><p>“Who are you?” asked the little prince, and added, “You are very pretty to look at.”</p><p>“I am a fox,” said the fox.</p><p>“Come and play with me,” proposed the little prince. “I am so unhappy.”</p><p>“I cannot play with you,” the fox said. “I am not <u>tamed</u>.”</p><p>“Ah! Please excuse me,” said the little prince.</p><p>But, after some thought, he added:</p><p>“What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“You do not live here,” said the fox. “What is it that you are looking for?”</p><p>“I am looking for men,” said the little prince. “What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“Men,” said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?”</p><p>“No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p><p>“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. It means to establish ties.”</p><p>“‘To establish ties’?”</p><p>“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…”</p><p>“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…”</p><p>“It is possible,” said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.”</p><h3 id="21-2-驯服一只狐狸"><a href="#21-2-驯服一只狐狸" class="headerlink" title="21-2 驯服一只狐狸"></a>21-2 驯服一只狐狸</h3><p>“Oh, but this is not on the Earth!” said the little prince.</p><p>The fox seemed <u>perplexed</u>, and very curious.</p><p>“On another planet?”</p><p>“Yes.”</p><p>“Are there hunters on this planet?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?”</p><p>“No.”</p><p>“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283907402038.jpg" alt="《小王子》中的猎人"></p><p>But he came back to his idea.</p><p>“My life is very <u>monotonous</u>,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life . I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my <u>burrow</u>. And then look: you see the grain-fields down <u>yonder</u>? I do not ea t bread. <u>Wheat</u> is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me bac k the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…”</p><p>The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p><p>“Please– tame me!” he said.</p><p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p><p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…”</p><p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me– like that– in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day…”</p><h3 id="21-3-特殊的仪式"><a href="#21-3-特殊的仪式" class="headerlink" title="21-3 特殊的仪式"></a>21-3 特殊的仪式</h3><p>The next day the little prince came back.</p><p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you… One must observe the <u>proper</u> <u>rites</u>…”</p><p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the <u>vineyards</u>. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”</p><p>So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure <u>drew</u> near–</p><p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p><p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…”</p><p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p><p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p><p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p><p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p><p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the color of the wheat fields.” And then he added:</p><p>“Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”</p><p>The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p><h3 id="21-4-我的玫瑰花"><a href="#21-4-我的玫瑰花" class="headerlink" title="21-4 我的玫瑰花"></a>21-4 我的玫瑰花</h3><p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.”</p><p>And the roses were very much embarrassed.</p><p>“You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you– the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284107402039.jpg" alt="小说《小王子》的狐狸"></p><p>And he went back to meet the fox.</p><p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p><p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”</p><p>“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><p>“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”</p><p>“It is the time I have wasted for my rose–” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose…”</p><p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p><h2 id="Chapter-22"><a href="#Chapter-22" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 22"></a>Chapter 22</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a railway switchman</p><p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p><p>“Good morning,” said the railway switchman.</p><p>“What do you do here?” the little prince asked.</p><p>“I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,” said the switchman. “I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left.”</p><p>And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman’s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.</p><p>“They are in a great hurry,” said the little prince. “What are they looking for?”</p><p>“Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,” said the switchman.</p><p>And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.</p><p>“Are they coming back already?” demanded the little prince.</p><p>“These are not the same ones,” said the switchman. “It is an exchange.”</p><p>“Were they not satisfied where they were?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“No one is ever satisfied where he is,” said the switchman.</p><p>And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.</p><p>“Are they pursuing the first travelers?” demanded the little prince.</p><p>“They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.”</p><p>“Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry…”</p><p>“They are lucky,” the switchman said.</p><h2 id="Chapter-23"><a href="#Chapter-23" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 23"></a>Chapter 23</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a merchant</p><p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p><p>“Good morning,” said the merchant.</p><p>This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.</p><p>“Why are you selling those?” asked the little prince.</p><p>“Because they save a tremendous amount of time,” said the merchant. “Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.”</p><p>“And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?”</p><p>“Anything you like…”</p><p>“As for me,” said the little prince to himself, “if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.”</p><h2 id="Chapter-24"><a href="#Chapter-24" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 24"></a>Chapter 24</h2><p>- the narrator and the little prince, thirsty, hunt for a well in the desert</p><p>It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.</p><p>“Ah,” I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!”</p><p>“My friend the fox–” the little prince said to me.</p><p>“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!”</p><p>“Why not?”</p><p>“Because I am about to die of thirst…”</p><p>He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:</p><p>“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend…”</p><p>“He has no way of guessing the danger,” I said to myself. “He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs…”</p><p>But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:</p><p>“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well…”</p><p>I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.</p><p>When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory:</p><p>“Then you are thirsty, too?” I demanded.</p><p>But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:</p><p>“Water may also be good for the heart…”</p><p>I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.</p><p>He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:</p><p>“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.”</p><p>I replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.</p><p>“The desert is beautiful,” the little prince added.</p><p>And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams…</p><p>“What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well…”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284307402039.jpg" alt="使沙漠更加美丽的，就是在某个角落里，藏着一口井"></p><p>I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart…</p><p>“Yes,” I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the desert– what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!”</p><p>“I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my fox.”</p><p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…”</p><p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower– the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…” And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…</p><p>And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</p><h2 id="Chapter-25"><a href="#Chapter-25" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 25"></a>Chapter 25</h2><p>- finding a well, the narrator and the little prince discuss his return to his planet</p><p>“Men,” said the little prince, “set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round…”</p><p>And he added:</p><p>“It is not worth the trouble…”</p><p>The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming…</p><p>“It is strange,” I said to the little prince. “Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope…”</p><p>He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284607402039.jpg" alt="《小王子》的水井"></p><p>“Do you hear?” said the little prince. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing…”</p><p>I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.</p><p>“Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.”</p><p>I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there– happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.</p><p>“I am thirsty for this water,” said the little prince. “Give me some of it to drink…”</p><p>And I understood what he had been looking for.</p><p>I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.</p><p>“The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden– and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”</p><p>“They do not find it,” I replied.</p><p>“And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”</p><p>“Yes, that is true,” I said.</p><p>And the little prince added:</p><p>“But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…”</p><p>I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?</p><p>“You must keep your promise,” said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.</p><p>“What promise?”</p><p>“You know– a muzzle for my sheep… I am responsible for this flower…”</p><p>I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:</p><p>“Your baobabs– they look a little like cabbages.”</p><p>“Oh!”</p><p>I had been so proud of my baobabs!</p><p>“Your fox– his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“You are not fair, little prince,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.”</p><p>“Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.”</p><p>So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.</p><p>“You have plans that I do not know about,” I said.</p><p>But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:</p><p>“You know– my descent to the earth… Tomorrow will be its anniversary.”</p><p>Then, after a silence, he went on:</p><p>“I came down very near here.”</p><p>And he flushed.</p><p>And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:</p><p>“Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you– a week ago– you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?”</p><p>The little prince flushed again.</p><p>And I added, with some hesitancy:</p><p>“Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?”</p><p>The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions– but when one flushes does that not mean “Yes”?</p><p>“Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened–”</p><p>But he interrupted me.</p><p>“Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening…”</p><p>But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed…</p><h2 id="Chapter-26"><a href="#Chapter-26" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 26"></a>Chapter 26</h2><p>- the little prince converses with the snake; the little prince consoles the narrator; the little prince returns to his planet</p><p>Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:</p><p>“Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.”</p><p>Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:</p><p>“Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.”</p><p>I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:</p><p>“–Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284807402040.jpg" alt="小王子和蛇"></p><p>I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.</p><p>After a silence the little prince spoke again:</p><p>“You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?”</p><p>I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.</p><p>“Now go away,” said the little prince. “I want to get down from the wall.”</p><p>I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall– and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.</p><p>I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.</p><p>“What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talking with snakes?”</p><p>I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone’s rifle…</p><p>“I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go back home–”</p><p>“How do you know about that?”</p><p>I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.</p><p>He made no answer to my question, but he added:</p><p>“I, too, am going back home today…”</p><p>Then, sadly–</p><p>“It is much farther… it is much more difficult…”</p><p>I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him…</p><p>His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.</p><p>“I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle…”</p><p>And he gave me a sad smile.</p><p>I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.</p><p>“Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid…”</p><p>He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.</p><p>“I shall be much more afraid this evening…”</p><p>Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.</p><p>“Little man,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.”</p><p>But he said to me:</p><p>“Tonight, it will be a year… my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago…”</p><p>“Little man,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream– this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star…”</p><p>But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen…”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers…”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember– how good it was.”</p><p>“Yes, I know…”</p><p>“And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens… they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present…”</p><p>He laughed again.</p><p>“Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!”</p><p>“That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water…”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems . For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You– you alone– will have the stars as no one else has them–”</p><p>“What are you trying to say?”</p><p>“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… you– only you– will have stars that can laugh!”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure… and your friends w ill be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you…”</p><p>And he laughed again.</p><p>“It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh…”</p><p>And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:</p><p>“Tonight– you know… do not come,” said the little prince.</p><p>“I shall not leave you,” I said.</p><p>“I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble…”</p><p>“I shall not leave you.”</p><p>But he was worried.</p><p>“I tell you– it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes– they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun…”</p><p>“I shall not leave you.”</p><p>But a thought came to reassure him:</p><p>“It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284907402040.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p><p>That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:</p><p>“Ah! You are there…”</p><p>And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.</p><p>“It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“You understand… it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:</p><p>“You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink…”</p><p>I said nothing.</p><p>“That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water…”</p><p>And he too said nothing more, because he was crying…</p><p>“Here it is. Let me go on by myself.”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285007402040.jpg" alt="他这时坐下来，因为他害怕了。"></p><p>And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:</p><p>“You know– my flower… I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so nae! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world…”</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285107402040.jpg" alt="他轻轻地象一棵树一样倒在地上，大概由于沙地的缘故，连一点响声都没有。"></p><p>I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.</p><p>“There now– that is all…”</p><p>He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.</p><p>There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.</p><h2 id="Chapter-27"><a href="#Chapter-27" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 27"></a>Chapter 27</h2><p>- the narrator’s afterthoughts</p><p>And now six years have already gone by…</p><p>I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I am tired.”</p><p>Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say– not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body… and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells…</p><p>But there is one extraordinary thing… when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower…</p><p>At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully…” Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.</p><p>But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night…” And then the little bells are changed to tears…</p><p>Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has– yes or no?– eaten a rose…</p><p>Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes…</p><p>And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!</p><p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285207402041.jpg" alt="在我看来，这是世界上最美、也最凄凉的景色。"></p><p>This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</p><p>Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back……</p></div><div><ul class="post-copyright"><li class="post-copyright-author"> <strong>本文作者：</strong> EchoSun</li><li class="post-copyright-link"> <strong>本文链接：</strong> <a href="https://blog.echosun.top/posts/30f86c62.html" title="The Little Prince">https://blog.echosun.top/posts/30f86c62.html</a></li><li class="post-copyright-license"> <strong>版权声明：</strong> 本博客所有文章除特别声明外，均采用<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-creative-commons"></i> BY-NC-SA</a> 许可协议。转载请注明出处！</li></ul></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"> <a href="/tags/The-Little-Prince/" rel="tag"># The Little Prince</a></div><div class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/posts/1d896b9.html" rel="prev" title="Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY"><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i> Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY</a></div><div class="post-nav-item"> <a href="/posts/807f4d4f.html" rel="next" title="机器视觉">机器视觉<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></footer></article></div><div class="tabs tabs-comment"><ul class="nav-tabs"><li class="tab"><a href="#comment-gitalk">gitalk</a></li><li class="tab"><a href="#comment-livere">livere</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div class="tab-pane gitalk" id="comment-gitalk"><div class="comments" id="gitalk-container"></div></div><div class="tab-pane livere" id="comment-livere"><div class="comments"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC81MjIxNi8yODY5Ng=="></div></div></div></div></div><script>
