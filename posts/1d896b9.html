morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.</p><p>“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”</p><p>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</p><p>And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.</p><p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p><p>“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”</p><p>He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The <u>hut</u> was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.</p><blockquote><ul><li>hut /hʌt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, simple building, usually consisting of one room:<br>a mountain hut<br>a row of beach huts</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large <u>balloon</u> was <u>swelling</u> inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.</p><blockquote><ul><li>balloon /bəˈluːn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, very thin rubber bag that you blow air into or fill with a light gas until it is round in shape, used for decoration at parties or as a children’s toy:<br>We tied balloons and streamers to the ceiling ready for the party.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/balloo_noun_001_01102.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of balloon"></p><ul><li>swelling /ˈswel.ɪŋ/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a part of your body that has become bigger because of illness or injury:<br>Put your foot into cold water to help the swelling go down.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Don’t do that.”</p><p>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.</p><p>“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</p><p>“What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, <u>peppermint</u> <u>humbugs</u>, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.</p><p>“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.</p><blockquote><ul><li>peppermint /ˈpep.ɚ.mɪnt/: <em>noun</em> a strong fresh flavoring from a type of mint plant, used especially to give flavor to candy:<br>She drinks peppermint-flavored tea.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/pepper_noun_002_27131.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of peppermint"></p><ul><li>humbug /ˈhʌm.bʌɡ/: <em>noun (SWEET)</em> a hard sweet, usually with a mint taste and strips of two different colors on the outside:<br>mint humbugs</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/humbug_noun_002_18402.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of humbug"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>魔法世界的钱币叫Knuts</p></blockquote><p>“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.”</p><p>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small <u>leather</u> pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.</p><blockquote><ul><li>leather /ˈleð.ɚ/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> animal skin treated in order to preserve it, and used to make shoes, bags, clothes, equipment, etc.:<br>a leather coat/belt/purse</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</p><p>“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”</p><p>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.</p><p>“Um — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.</p><p>“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”</p><p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”</p><p>“But if their house was destroyed —”</p><p>“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”</p><blockquote><p>海格要带哈利去古灵阁Gringotts 取父母留给哈利的遗产。</p></blockquote><p>“Wizards have banks?”</p><p>“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by <u>goblins</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>goblin /ˈɡɑː.blɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> (in stories) a small, ugly creature that is harmful to humans</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</p><p>“Goblins?”</p><p>“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.</p><p>“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”</p><p>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea <u>gleamed</u> in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.</p><p>“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gleam /ɡliːm/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to produce or reflect a small, bright light:<br>He polished the table until it gleamed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Flew,” said Hagrid.</p><p>“Flew?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”</p><p>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.</p><p>“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”</p><p>“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.</p><p>“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Spells — <u>enchantments</u>,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security <u>vaults</u>. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>enchantment /ɪnˈtʃænt.mənt/: <em>noun (PLEASURE)</em> a feeling of great pleasure and attraction, especially because something is very beautiful:<br>The audience looked on in utter fascination and enchantment.<br>This is a place of enchantment and beauty.</li><li>vault /vɑːlt/: <em>noun (ARCH)</em> a type of arch that supports a roof or ceiling, especially in a church or public building, or a ceiling or roof supported by several of these arches</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/vault_noun_002_39917.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of vault"></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>古灵阁在伦敦地下几百英里深的地方，重要的宝库被龙把守。</p></blockquote><p>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.</p><p>“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.</p><p>“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.</p><p>“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”</p><p>“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”</p><p>“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”</p><p>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the <u>harbor</u> wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they <u>clambered</u> up the stone steps onto the street.</p><blockquote><ul><li>harbor /ˈhɑːr.bɚ/: <em>verb (HAVE IN MIND)</em> an area of water next to the coast, often protected from the ocean by a thick wall, where ships and boats can shelter:<br>Our hotel room overlooked a pretty little fishing harbor.</li><li>clamber /ˈklæm.bɚ/: <em>verb [ I usually + adv/prep ]</em> to climb up, across, or into somewhere with difficulty, using the hands and the feet:<br>They clambered over/up the rocks.<br>I clambered into/onto the bus.<br>She clambered into bed.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t <u>blame</u> them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”</p><blockquote><ul><li>blame /bleɪm/: <em>verb [ T ]</em> to say or think that someone or something did something wrong or is responsible for something bad happening:<br>Don’t blame me (= it is not my fault) if you miss the bus!<br>Hugh blames his mother for his lack of confidence.<br>Hugh blames his lack of confidence on his mother.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”</p><p>“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”</p><p>“You’d like one?”</p><p>“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”</p><blockquote><p>海格从小的时候就想要养一只龙。</p></blockquote><p>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.</p><p>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a <u>canary</u>-yellow <u>circus</u> tent.</p><blockquote><ul><li>canary /kəˈner.i/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, yellow bird that is well

aloud.</p><p>“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.</p><p>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.</p><p>“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down <u>escalator</u> that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.</p><blockquote><ul><li>escalator /ˈes.kə.leɪ.t̬ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a set of stairs moved up or down by electric power on which people can stand and be taken from one level of a building to another, especially in stores, railroad stations, and airports:<br>I’ll meet you by the up/down escalator on the second floor.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/escala_noun_002_12711.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of escalator"></p></blockquote><p>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and <u>broomsticks</u>? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.</p><blockquote><ul><li>broomstick /ˈbruːm.stɪk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a broom made of sticks:<br>In children’s books, witches are often shown riding broomsticks.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brooms_noun_002_04678.jpg?version=5.0.170" alt="picture of broomstick"></p></blockquote><p>“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”</p><p>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.</p><blockquote><p>海格带着哈利来到 “破釜酒吧”(the Leaky Cauldron) 。只有会魔法的人可以看到它。</p></blockquote><p>For a famous place, it was very dark and <u>shabby</u>. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of <u>sherry</u>. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old <u>bartender</u>, who was quite <u>bald</u> and looked like a toothless <u>walnut</u>. The low <u>buzz</u> of <u>chatter</u> stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”</p><blockquote><ul><li>shabby /ˈʃæb.i/: <em>adjective (BAD CONDITION)</em> looking old and in bad condition because of being used for a long time or not being cared for:<br>He wore a shabby old overcoat.<br>Her home is a rented one-bedroom apartment in a shabby part of town.<br>The refugees were shabby (= wore old clothes in bad condition) and hungry.</li><li>sherry /ˈʃer.i/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a type of strong wine from southern Spain that is a pale yellow or brown color, sometimes drunk before a meal:<br>sweet/dry sherry<br>Would you like a glass of sherry/some sherry?<br>Would you like a sherry (= a glass of sherry)?</li><li>bartender /ˈbɑːrˌten.dɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> someone who makes and serves drinks in a bar</li><li>bald /bɑːld/: <em>adjective (NO HAIR)</em> with little or no hair on the head:<br>At 20 he was already going bald.</li><li>walnut /ˈwɑːl.nʌt/: <em>noun</em> a nut with a slightly bitter taste, a series of folds in it, and a hard shell:<br>Sprinkle with chopped walnuts to serve.<br>a pear and walnut salad<br>walnut cookies</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/walnut_noun_002_40493.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of walnut"></p><ul><li>buzz /bʌz/: <em>verb (MAKE SOUND)</em> to make a continuous, low sound such as the one a bee makes:<br>I can hear something buzzing.</li><li>chatter /ˈtʃæt̬.ɚ/: <em>verb (TALK/NOISE)</em> to talk for a long time about things that are not important:<br>She spent the morning chattering away to her friends.<br>He chattered happily about nothing in particular.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees <u>buckle</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>buckle /ˈbʌk.əl/: verb (FASTEN) to fasten or be fastened with a buckle</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this can this be — ?”</p><p>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.</p><p>“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . what an honor.”</p><p>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</p><p>“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”</p><p>Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was <u>puffing</u> on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.</p><blockquote><ul><li>puff /pʌf/: <em>verb (BREATHE)</em> to breathe fast and with difficulty, usually because you have been exercising:<br>He came puffing up the stairs.<br>[ + speech ] “I ran all the way home,” she puffed (= said while puffing).</li></ul></blockquote><p>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.</p><p>“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”</p><p>“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”</p><p>“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a <u>flutter</u>.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>flutter /ˈflʌt̬.ɚ/: <em>verb (MOVE)</em> to make a series of quick delicate movements up and down or from side to side, or to cause something to do this:<br>Brightly colored flags were fluttering in the breeze.<br>Leaves fluttered down onto the path.<br>Butterflies fluttered about in the sunshine.<br>A white bird poised on a wire and fluttered its wings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.”</p><p>“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”</p><p>“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”</p><p>Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.</p><p>A <u>pale</u> young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was <u>twitching</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>pale /peɪl/: <em>adjective</em> used to describe a person’s face or skin if it has less color than usual, for example when the person is or sick or frightened, or if it has less color than people generally have:<br>You’re looking pale - are you feeling well?<br>She has a naturally pale complexion and dark hair.</li><li>twitch /twɪtʃ/: <em>verb (MOVE SLIGHTLY)</em> (to cause) to make a sudden small movement with a part of the body, usually without intending to:<br>He tried to suppress a smile but felt the corner of his mouth twitch.<br>She twitched her nose like a rabbit.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”</p><blockquote><p>奇洛教授（Quirrell）出现。黑魔法防御术的老师。</p></blockquote><p>“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”</p><p>“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”</p><p>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose?

It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the <u>babble</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>babble /ˈbæb.əl/: <em>verb (TALK)</em> to talk or say something in a quick, confused, excited, or silly way:<br>The children babbled excitedly among themselves.<br>She was babbling something about her ring being stolen.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”</p><p>Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.</p><p>Hagrid <u>grinned</u> at Harry.</p><blockquote><ul><li>grin /ɡrɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a wide smile:<br>I assumed things had gone well for him because he had a big grin on his face.<br>a broad/sheepish grin</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/grin_noun_002_16558.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of grin"></p></blockquote><p>“Told yeh, didn’t I?

Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</p><p>“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”</p><p>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.</p><p>The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</p><p>“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”</p><blockquote><p>海格用伞敲击垃圾箱上的砖块，打开了通向对角巷的路。</p></blockquote><p>He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.</p><blockquote><ul><li>archway /ˈɑːrtʃ.weɪ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> an entrance or passage formed by an arch</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/archwa_noun_002_01520.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of archway"></p></blockquote><p>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.</p><p>“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”</p><p>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.</p><p>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with <u>broomsticks</u> in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . .</p><blockquote><ul><li>broomstick /ˈbruːm.stɪk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a broom made of sticks:<br>In children’s books, witches are often shown riding broomsticks.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brooms_noun_002_04678.jpg?version=5.0.172" alt="picture of broomstick"></p></blockquote><p>“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.</p><p>They had reached a snowy white building that towered over the other little shops. Standing beside its <u>burnished</u> <u>bronze</u> doors, wearing a uniform of <u>scarlet</u> and gold, was —</p><blockquote><ul><li>burnished /ˈbɝː.nɪʃt/: <em>adjective</em> smooth and shiny, usually because of being polished (= rubbed):<br>The case is burnished aluminum.<br>burnished mahogany doors</li><li>bronze /brɑːnz/: <em>noun</em> a brown metal made of copper and tin:<br>The church bells are made of bronze.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/bronze_noun_002_04664.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of bronze"></p><ul><li>scarlet /ˈskɑːr.lət/: <em>noun [ U ], adjective</em> bright red:<br>scarlet berries<br>He went scarlet with shame.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a <u>swarthy</u>, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, <u>silver</u> this time, with words <u>engraved</u> upon them:</p><blockquote><ul><li>swarthy /ˈswɔːr.ði/: <em>adjective</em> (of a person or their skin) dark:<br>a swarthy face/complexion<br>a swarthy fisherman</li><li>silver /ˈsɪl.vɚ/: <em>noun (METAL)</em> a chemical element that is a valuable shiny, white metal, used for making silverware (= knives, spoons, etc.), jewelry, coins, and decorative objects:<br>We gave them a dish made of solid silver as a wedding present.<br>Cleaning the silver (= silver objects) is a dirty job.<br>Should we use the silver (= knives, spoons, plates, etc. made of silver) for dinner tonight?<br>UK I need some silver (= coins made of silver or a metal of similar appearance) for the ticket machine in the car park.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/silver_noun_002_33834.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of silver"></p><ul><li>engrave /ɪnˈɡreɪv/: <em>verb [ T ]</em> to cut words, pictures, or patterns into the surface of metal, stone, etc.:<br>The jeweler skillfully engraved the initials on the ring.<br>The bracelet was engraved with his name and date of birth.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Enter, stranger, but take heed Of what awaits the sin of greed, For those who take, but do not earn, Must pay most dearly in their turn. So if you seek beneath our floors A treasure that was never yours,</p><p>Thief, you have been warned, beware Of finding more than treasure there.</p><p>“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.</p><p>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast <u>marble</u> hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high <u>stools</u> behind a long counter, <u>scribbling</u> in large <u>ledgers</u>, weighing coins in <u>brass</u> scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.</p><blockquote><ul><li>marble /ˈmɑːr.bəl/: <em>noun (ROCK)</em> a type of very hard rock that has a pattern of lines going through it, feels cold, and can be polished to become smooth and shiny:<br>a marble floor/statue</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marble_noun_002_22381.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of marble"></p><ul><li>stool /stuːl/: <em>noun (SEAT)</em> a seat without any support for the back or arms:<br>a bar/kitchen/piano stool<br>a three-legged stool</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stool_noun_002_36042.jpg?version=5.0.180" alt="picture of stool"></p><ul><li>scribble /ˈskrɪb.əl/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to write or draw something quickly or carelessly:<br>The baby’s just scribbled all over my new dictionary!<br>[ + two objects ] I’ll just scribble Dad a note/scribble a note to Dad to say we’re going out.</li><li>ledger /ˈledʒ.ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a book in which things are regularly recorded, especially business activities and money received or paid</li><li>brass /bræs/: <em>noun (METAL)</em> a bright yellow metal made from copper and zinc:<br>The door handles were made of brass.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/brass_noun_002_04427.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of brass"></p></blockquote><p>“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”</p><p>“You have his key, sir?”</p><p>“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of <u>moldy</u> dog <u>biscuits</u> over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.</p><blockquote><ul><li>moldy /ˈmoʊl.di/: <em>adjective (HAVING MOLD)</em> covered with mold:<br>moldy bread/cheese</li><li>biscuit /ˈbɪs.kɪt/: <em>noun (BREAD)</em> a type of bread usually baked in small, round pieces:<br>baking-powder biscuits<br>biscuits and gravy</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.</p><p>The goblin looked at it closely.</p><p>“That seems to be in order.”</p><p>“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”</p><p>The goblin read the letter carefully.</p><p>“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”</p><blockquote><p>Griphook 是另一个妖精,带着哈利和海格去 713 号地下金库取宝物和哈利父母留给哈利的财宝.</p></blockquote><p>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</p><p>“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.</p><p>“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”</p><p>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more <u>marble</u>, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small <u>cart</u> came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.</p><blockquote><ul><li>marble /ˈmɑːr.bəl/: <em>noun (ROCK)</em> a type of very hard rock that has a pattern of lines going through it, feels cold, and can be polished to become smooth and shiny:<br>a marble floor/statue</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marble_noun_002_22381.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of marble"></p><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of cart"></p></blockquote><p>At first they just <u>hurtled</u> through a <u>maze</u> of <u>twisting</u> <u>passages</u>. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The <u>rattling</u> cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.</p><blockquote><ul><li>hurtle /ˈhɝː.t̬əl/: <em>verb [ I usually + adv/prep ]</em> to move very fast, especially in a way that seems dangerous:<br>The truck came hurtling toward us.<br>The explosion sent pieces of metal and glass hurtling through the air.</li><li>maze /meɪz/: <em>noun (PLACE)</em> a complicated system of paths or passages that people try to find their way through for entertainment</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/maze_noun_002_22730.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of maze"></p><ul><li>twisting /ˈtwɪs·tɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> having a lot of turns or changes of direction:<br>a twisting country road</li><li>passage /ˈpæs.ɪdʒ/: <em>noun (CONNECTING WAY)</em> a usually long and narrow part of a building with rooms on one or both sides, or a covered path that connects places:<br>A narrow passage led directly through the house into the garden.<br>The bathroom’s on the right at the end of the passage.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/passag_noun_002_26656.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of passage"></p><ul><li>rattle /ˈræt̬.əl/: <em>verb (WORRY)</em> a sound similar to a series of quickly repeated knocks:<br>From across the town came the rattle of machine-gun fire.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/rattle_noun_002_30214.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of rattle"></p></blockquote><p>Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge <u>stalactites</u> and <u>stalagmites</u> grew from the <u>ceiling</u> and floor.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stalactite /stə.ˈlæk.taɪt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a column of rock that hangs from the roof of a cave and is formed over a very long period of time by drops of water containing lime falling from the roof</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stalac_noun_002_35561.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stalactite"></p><ul><li>stalagmite /stə.ˈlæɡ.maɪt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a column of rock that rises from the floor of a cave, formed over a very long period of time by drops of water containing lime falling from the roof of the cave</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stalag_noun_002_35562.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stalagmite"></p><ul><li>ceiling /ˈsiː.lɪŋ/: <em>noun (TOP OF A ROOM)</em> the inside surface of a room that you can see when you look above you</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/ceilin_noun_002_06013.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of ceiling"></p></blockquote><p>“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”</p><p>“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p><p>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</p><p>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry <u>gasped</u>. Inside were <u>mounds</u> of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gasp /ɡæsp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to take a short, quick breath through the mouth, especially because of surprise, pain, or shock:<br>When she saw the money hidden in the box she gasped in surprise.<br>[ + speech ] “Help me!” he gasped.</li><li>mound /maʊnd/: <em>noun (PILE)</em> a large pile of earth, stones, etc. like a small hill:<br>a burial mound (= a place where people were buried in ancient times)</li></ul></blockquote><p>“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.</p><p>All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small <u>fortune</u> belonging to him, buried deep under London.</p><blockquote><ul><li>fortune /ˈfɔːr.tʃuːn/: <em>noun (WEALTH)</em> a large amount of money, goods, property, etc.:<br>She inherited a fortune from her grandmother.<br>He lost a fortune gambling.<br>You can make a fortune out of junk if you call it antiques.<br>This dress cost a (small) fortune.<br>Any painting by Van Gogh is worth a fortune.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</p><p>“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”</p><blockquote><p>金币是Galleons</p><p>银币是Sickles</p><p>青铜币是Knuts</p><p>1 Galleons = 17 Sickles</p><p>1 Sickles = 29 Knuts</p></blockquote><p>“One speed only,” said Griphook.</p><p>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the <u>scruff</u> of his neck.</p><blockquote><ul><li>scruff /skrʌf/: <em>noun (NECK)</em> by the skin at the back of the neck:<br>Cats carry their kittens by the scruff of the neck.<br>I took/grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him out of the hall.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</p><p>“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.</p><p>“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.</p><p>“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.</p><p>“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.</p><p>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.</p><p>“Come on, back in this <u>infernal</u> cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.</p><blockquote><ul><li>infernal /ɪnˈfɝː.nəl/: <em>adjective</em> very bad or unpleasant:<br>What an infernal noise!</li></ul></blockquote><p>One wild <u>cart</u> ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.</p><blockquote><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.177" alt="picture of cart"></p></blockquote><p>“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.</p><p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.</p><p>“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”</p><h2 id="初遇马尔福"><a href="#初遇马尔福" class="headerlink" title="初遇马尔福"></a>初遇马尔福</h2><p>In the back of the shop, a boy with a <u>pale</u>, <u>pointed</u> face was standing on a <u>footstool</u> while a <u>second</u> <u>witch</u> pinned up his long black <u>robes</u>.

Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”</p><blockquote><ul><li>piercing /ˈpɪr.sɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> going through or into something: 穿透的<br>Troops have been issued with new armor-piercing anti-tank grenades.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.</p><p>“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then <u>wrist</u> to <u>elbow</u>, shoulder to floor, knee to <u>armpit</u> and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, <u>phoenix</u> <u>tail</u> <u>feathers</u>, and the <u>heartstrings</u> of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>wrist /rɪst/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the part of the body between the hand and the arm:<br>I sprained my wrist playing tennis.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/wrist_noun_001_19532.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of wrist"></p><ul><li>elbow /ˈel.boʊ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the part in the middle of the arm where it bends, or the part of a piece of clothing that covers this area:<br>Her arm was bandaged from the elbow to the fingers.<br>The sleeve of his shirt was torn at the elbow.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/elbow_noun_002_12193.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of elbow"></p><ul><li>armpit /ˈɑːrm.pɪt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the hollow place under your arm where your arm joins your body:<br>sweaty/hairy armpits</li><li>phoenix /ˈfiː.nɪks/: <em>noun [ C usually singular ]</em> in ancient stories, an imaginary bird that set fire to itself every 500 years and was born again, rising from its ashes (= the powder left after its body has been burned):<br>The town was bombed but was then rebuilt and rose from the ashes like a/the phoenix (= was just as good as before).</li><li>tail /teɪl/: <em>noun (ANIMAL)</em> a part of an animal’s body, sticking out from the base of the back, or something similar in shape or position:<br>The dog wagged its tail excitedly.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/tail_noun_002_37197.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of tail"></p><ul><li>feather /ˈfeð.ɚ/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> one of the many soft, light things that cover a bird’s body, consisting of a long, thin, central part with material like hairs along each side:<br>peacock/ostrich feathers<br>feather pillows (= those containing feathers)<br>The bird ruffled its feathers.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/feathe_noun_002_13549.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of feather"></p><ul><li>heartstrings /ˈhɑːrt.strɪŋz/: <em>noun [ plural ]</em> to cause strong feelings of love or sympathy: 神经<br>It’s the story of a lost child - guaranteed to tug at the heartstrings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his <u>nostrils</u>, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.</p><blockquote><ul><li>nostril /ˈnɑː.strəl/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> either of the two openings in the nose through which air moves when you breathe:<br>The horses came to a halt, steam streaming from their nostrils.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/nostri_noun_002_25088.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of nostril"></p></blockquote><p>“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure <u>crumpled</u> into a <u>heap</u> on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. <u>Beechwood</u> and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>crumpled /ˈkrʌm.pəld/: <em>adjective</em> full of folds:<br>crumpled clothes<br>the crumpled charm of linen</li><li>heap /hiːp/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a messy pile or mass of things:<br>a heap of clothes/trash</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/heap_noun_002_17433.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of heap"></p><ul><li>Beechwood n. 山毛榉材</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.</p><p>“<u>Maple</u> and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”</p><blockquote><ul><li>maple /ˈmeɪ.pəl/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a type of large tree that grows in northern areas of the world, or the wood of this tree: 槭树，枫树<br>a maple leaf<br>maple trees</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/maple_noun_002_22368.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of maple"></p></blockquote><p>Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was <u>snatched</u> back by Mr. Ollivander.</p><blockquote><ul><li>snatch /snætʃ/: <em>verb (TAKE QUICKLY)</em> to take hold of something suddenly and roughly:夺走<br>He snatched the photos out of my hand before I had a chance to look at them.<br>figurative Running the best race of his career, Fletcher snatched (= only just won) the gold medal from the Canadian champion.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“No, no — here, <u>ebony</u> and unicorn hair, eight and a half inches, springy.

And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.</p><blockquote><p>这里跟电影版有点不一样，电影中夸张了这里的情节，认为如果是不合适的魔杖挥一下就会搞破坏，但是原文中奥利凡德先生就是让哈利拿一下魔杖就知道这个魔杖合不合适他（最多挥一下），而且让哈利试了很多很多魔杖。</p></blockquote><p>“<u>Tricky</u> customer, eh?

He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold <u>sparks</u> shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid <u>whooped</u> and <u>clapped</u> and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how <u>curious</u> . . . how very curious . . .”</p><blockquote><ul><li>spark /spɑːrk/: <em>noun (FIRE/ELECTRICITY)</em> a very small piece of fire that flies out from something that is burning, or one that is made by rubbing two hard things together, or a flash of light made by electricity:<br>Sparks were flying out of the bonfire and blowing everywhere.<br>You can start a fire by rubbing two dry pieces of wood together until you produce a spark.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/spark_noun_002_34982.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of spark"></p><ul><li>whoop /wuːp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to give a loud, excited shout, especially to show your enjoyment of or agreement with something:<br>The audience was whooping and clapping.</li><li>clap /klæp/: <em>verb (MAKE NOISE)</em> to make a short loud noise by hitting your hands together:<br>“When I clap my hands, you stand still,” said the teacher.<br>The band played a familiar tune which had everyone clapping along.<br>The audience clapped in time to the music.</li><li>curious /ˈkjʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (INTERESTED)</em> interested in learning about people or things around you:<br>I was curious to know what would happen next.奇妙的<br>Babies are curious about everything around them.<br>“Why did you ask?” “I was just curious.”</li></ul></blockquote><p>He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”</p><p>“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”</p><p>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale <u>stare</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stare /ster/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking: 凝视<br>Don’t stare at people like that, it’s rude.<br>Chuck sat quietly for hours staring into the distance, thinking of what might have been.<br>During the press conference, each boxer tried to stare the other down (= force the other to look away by continual staring).</li></ul></blockquote><p>“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be <u>destined</u> for this wand when its brother why, its brother gave you that scar.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>destined /ˈdes.tɪnd/: <em>adjective (PURPOSE)</em> intended (for a particular purpose): 注定<br>The money was destined for the relief of poverty, but was diverted by corrupt officials.<br>These cars are destined for the European market.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry <u>swallowed</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swallow /ˈswɑː.loʊ/: <em>verb (THROAT)</em> to cause food, drink, pills, etc. to move from your mouth into your stomach by using the muscles of your throat: 由于紧张害怕而做吞咽动作。<br>My throat is so sore that it really hurts when I swallow.<br>He put a grape into his mouth and swallowed it whole.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”</p><p>Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.</p><blockquote><p>哈利的魔杖是十三英寸半场的紫杉木和凤凰尾羽。7加隆买下的。</p></blockquote><p>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were <u>gawking</u> at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s <u>lap</u>. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.</p><blockquote><ul><li>gawk /ɡɑːk/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to look at something or someone in a stupid or rude way:呆呆地看<br>Don’t sit there gawking like that - give me a hand!<br>They just stood there gawking at me.</li><li>lap /læp/: <em>noun (LEGS)</em> the top surface of the upper part of the legs of a person who is sitting down: 坐下的人的腿上面<br>Come and sit on my lap and I’ll read you a story.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.</p><p>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.</p><p>“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.</p><p>Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.</p><p>“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”</p><p>Hagrid <u>leaned</u> across the table. Behind the <u>wild</u> <u>beard</u> and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.</p><blockquote><ul><li>lean /liːn/: <em>adjective (NO FAT)</em> to (cause to) slope in one direction, or to move the top part of the body in a particular direction: 探身<br>She leaned forward and whispered something in my ear.<br>I sat down next to Bernard, who leaned over to me and said “You’re late.”<br>Lean your head back a little.<br>That fence is leaning to the right.</li><li>wild /waɪld/: <em>adjective (NOT CONTROLLED)</em> uncontrolled, violent, or extreme: 杂乱的<br>a wild party<br>wild dancing<br>The audience burst into wild applause.<br>When I told him what I’d done, he went wild (= became very angry).<br>The children were wild with excitement (= were extremely excited).<br>Her eyes were wild/She had a wild look in her eyes (= her eyes were wide open, as if frightened or mentally ill).<br>His hair was wild (= long and messy) and his clothes full of holes.<br>There have been wild (= extreme) variations in the level of spending.<br>They get some wild weather (= many severe storms) in the north.<br>It was a wild (= stormy or very windy) night, with the wind howling and the rain pouring down.</li><li>beard /bɪrd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the hair that some men allow to grow on the lower part of their face:<br>a flowing white beard<br>He’s growing a beard.<br>He shaved off his beard but kept his mustache.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/beard_noun_002_02901.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of beard"></p></blockquote><p>“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”</p><p>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</p><p>“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.”</p><blockquote><p>海格给哈利送上了回德思礼家的火车，并且给了他去霍格沃茨的车票。九月一号，国王十字车站。</p></blockquote><p>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he <u>rose in his seat</u> and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</p><blockquote><p> rose in his seat 翻译成跪在他的座位上。</p></blockquote></div><div><ul class="post-copyright"><li class="post-copyright-author"> <strong>本文作者：</strong> EchoSun</li><li class="post-copyright-link"> <strong>本文链接：</strong> <a href="https://blog.echosun.top/posts/1d896b9.html" title="Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY">https://blog.echosun.top/posts/1d896b9.html</a></li><li class="post-copyright-license"> <strong>版权声明：</strong> 本博客所有文章除特别声明外，均采用<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/" rel="external nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><i class="fab fa-fw fa-creative-commons"></i> BY-NC-SA</a> 许可协议。转载请注明出处！</li></ul></div><footer class="post-footer"><div class="post-tags"> <a href="/tags/Harry-Potter-and-the-Sorcerer-s-Stone/" rel="tag"># Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</a></div><div class="post-nav"><div class="post-nav-item"><a href="/posts/1f4ea593.html" rel="prev" title="Harry Potter 1-4 THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS"><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i> Harry Potter 1-4 THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS</a></div><div class="post-nav-item"> <a href="/posts/30f86c62.html" rel="next" title="The Little Prince">The Little Prince<i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></footer></article></div><div class="tabs tabs-comment"><ul class="nav-tabs"><li class="tab"><a href="#comment-gitalk">gitalk</a></li><li class="tab"><a href="#comment-livere">livere</a></li></ul><div class="tab-content"><div class="tab-pane gitalk" id="comment-gitalk"><div class="comments" id="gitalk-container"></div></div><div class="tab-pane livere" id="comment-livere"><div class="comments"><div id="lv-container" data-id="city" data-uid="MTAyMC81MjIxNi8yODY5Ng=="></div></div></div></div></div><script>
