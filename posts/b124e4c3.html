Nine and three quarters 从九又四分之三站台开始的旅程</h2><p>Harry’s last month with the Dursleys wasn’t fun. True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half <u>furious</u>, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.</p><blockquote><ul><li>furious /ˈfʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (ANGRY)</em> extremely angry:<br>I was late and he was furious with me.<br>He’s furious about/at the way he’s been treated.<br>We had a furious debate about the death penalty.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig <u>swooping</u> in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to <u>vacuum</u> anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead <u>mice</u>. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry <u>ticked off</u> another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.</p><blockquote><p>哈利的猫头鹰叫 Hedwig （海德薇）</p></blockquote><blockquote><ul><li><p>swoop /swuːp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to move very quickly and easily through the air, especially down from a high position in order to attack: 俯冲<br>The eagle swooped down to snatch a young rabbit.</p></li><li><p>vacuum /ˈvæk.juːm/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to use a vacuum cleaner to collect dust, dirt, etc.:</p><p>Vacuum (up) the cake crumbs, would you?</p></li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/vacuum_noun_002_39800.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of vacuum"></p><ul><li>mice /ma：ɪs/: plural of mouse</li><li>ticked off: <em>phrasal verb with tick verb</em> to put a mark beside an item in a list to show that you have dealt with it:</li></ul></blockquote><p>On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a <u>quiz</u> show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.</p><blockquote><ul><li>quiz /kwɪz/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a game or competition in which you answer questions:竞猜<br>a history/sports, etc. quiz<br>There are so many inane television quiz shows.<br>UK A lot of pubs have quiz nights once or twice a week.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Er — Uncle Vernon?” Uncle Vernon <u>grunted</u> to show he was listening.</p><blockquote><ul><li>grunt /ɡrʌnt/: <em>noun (LOW SOUND)</em> (of a person) to make a short, low sound instead of speaking, usually because of anger or pain:哼了一声<br>He hauled himself over the wall, grunting with the effort.<br>[ + speech ] “Too tired,” he grunted and sat down.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”</p><p>Uncle Vernon grunted again.</p><p>“Would it be all right if you <u>gave me a lift</u>?” Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.</p><blockquote><ul><li>lift /lɪft/: <em>noun [C] (JOURNEY)</em> a free trip in another person’s vehicle, esp. a car:<br>Can I give you a lift home?</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Thank you.”</p><p>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.</p><p>“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Harry didn’t say anything.</p><blockquote><ul><li>carpet /ˈkɑːr.pət/: <em>verb (COVER)</em> (a shaped piece of) thick material used for covering floors:地毯<br>We’ve just had a new carpet fitted/laid in our bedroom.<br>UK We’ve got fitted (= cut to fit exactly) carpets in the bedrooms.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/carpet_noun_002_05700.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of carpet"></p></blockquote><p>“Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.</p><p>“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.</p><p>His aunt and uncle <u>stared</u>.</p><blockquote><ul><li>stare /ster/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking: 吃惊地瞪大眼睛<br>Don’t stare at people like that, it’s rude.<br>Chuck sat quietly for hours staring into the distance, thinking of what might have been.<br>During the press conference, each boxer tried to stare the other down (= force the other to look away by continual staring).</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.”</p><p>“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”</p><p>“It’s on my ticket.”</p><p>“<u>Barking</u>,” said Uncle Vernon, “<u>howling</u> <u>mad</u>, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”</p><blockquote><ul><li>barking /ˈbɑːr.kɪŋ/: <em>adjective [ after verb ]</em> crazy or extremely silly:胡说<br>She must have been barking mad to lend him so much money.</li><li>howling /ˈhaʊ.lɪŋ/: <em>adjective (WIND)</em> (of the wind) blowing hard and making a lot of noise: 咆哮的<br>Once we played miniature golf in a howling gale.<br>The hurricane’s howling destructive winds just missed the island.</li><li>mad /mæd/: <em>*adjective</em> (SILLY)* extremely silly or stupid: 疯子<br>[ + to infinitive ] You’re mad to walk home alone at this time of night.<br>He must be mad spending all that money on a coat.<br>Some of the things she does are completely mad.</li></ul></blockquote><p>“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.</p><p>“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”</p><blockquote><p>电影没有交代，一直到哈利去学校，达利的尾巴还在屁股上，因此弗农夫妇准备带他去伦敦做手术，这才顺路带哈利去国王十字车站。</p></blockquote><p>Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s <u>robes</u> — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then <u>paced</u> the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy <u>trunk</u> had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.</p><blockquote><ul><li>robe /roʊb/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a long, loose piece of clothing worn especially on very formal occasions:<br>Judges wear black robes when they are in court.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/robe_noun_002_31345.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of robe"></p><ul><li>pace /peɪs/: <em>noun (SPEED)</em> the speed at which someone or something moves, or with which something happens or changes: 踱步<br>a slow/fast pace<br>When she thought she heard someone following her, she quickened her pace.<br>Could you slow down - I can’t keep pace with (= walk or run as fast as) you.<br>For many years this company has set the pace (= has been the most successful company) in the communications industry.<br>These changes seem to me to be happening at too fast a pace.<br>I don’t like the pace of modern life.</li><li>trunk /trʌŋk/: <em>noun (CONTAINER)</em> a large, strong container that is used for storing clothes and personal possessions, often when traveling or going to live in a new place</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/trunk_noun_002_39167.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of trunk"></p></blockquote><p>They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a <u>cart</u> and <u>wheeled</u> it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a <u>nasty</u> <u>grin</u> on his face.</p><blockquote><ul><li>cart /kɑːrt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a vehicle with either two or four wheels, pulled by a horse and used for carrying goods:<br>a horse and cart</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/cart_noun_002_05747.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of cart"></p><ul><li>wheel /wiːl/: <em>verb (PUSH)</em> to push an object that has wheels so that it moves in a particular direction:<br>I saw her last night wheeling a stroller along Green Lane.<br>Halfway through the talk someone wheeled in a cart with sandwiches .<br>Doctors put her on a respirator and wheeled her downstairs to intensive care.</li><li>nasty /ˈnæs.ti/: <em>adjective</em> bad or very unpleasant: 不怀好意的<br>a nasty shock/surprise<br>There’s a nasty smell in here.<br>He had a nasty cut above the eye.<br>She has a nasty habit of picking on people in meetings.</li><li>grin /ɡrɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a wide smile: 咧嘴笑<br>I assumed things had gone well for him because he had a big grin on his face.<br>a broad/sheepish grin</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/grin_noun_002_16558.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of grin"></p></blockquote><p>“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”</p><p>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</p><p>“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even <u>nastier</u> smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.</p><blockquote><ul><li>nasty /ˈnæs.ti/: <em>adjective</em> bad or very unpleasant: 不怀好意的<br>a nasty shock/surprise<br>There’s a nasty smell in here.<br>He had a nasty cut above the eye.<br>She has a nasty habit of picking on people in meetings.</li></ul></blockquote><p>He stopped a passing <u>guard</u>, but didn’t <u>dare</u> mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard <u>strode</u> away, <u>muttering</u> about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was <u>stranded</u> in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.</p><blockquote><ul><li>guard /ɡɑːrd/: <em>noun (PERSON WHO PROTECTS)</em> a person or group of people whose job is to protect a person, place, or thing from danger or attack, or to prevent a person such as a criminal from escaping: 守卫<br>prison guards<br>security guards<br>There are guards posted (= standing and watching) at every entrance.<br>Armed guards are posted around the site.<br>The frontier is patrolled by border guards.</li><li>dare /der/: <em>verb (BE BRAVE/RUDE)</em> to be brave enough to do something difficult or dangerous, or to be rude or silly enough to do something that you have no right to do:<br>I was going to ask if his dog was better, but I didn’t dare in case she had died.<br>[ + (to) infinitive ] Everyone in the office complains that he smells awful, but nobody dares (to) mention it to him.<br>[ + infinitive without to ] I wouldn’t dare have a party in my apartment in case the neighbors complained.<br>Dare you tell him the news?<br>I don’t dare think how much it’s going to cost.<br>UK I daren’t think how much it’s going to cost.<br>UK Do you dare (to) tell him the news?<br>I’d never dare (to) talk to my mother the way Brandon talks to his.<br>[ + to infinitive ] He was under attack for daring to criticize the mayor.</li><li>stride /straɪd/: <em>noun (STEP)</em> a long step when walking or running: 大步<br>She attributes her record-breaking speed to the length of her stride.</li><li>mutter /ˈmʌt̬.ɚ/: <em>noun (QUIET WORDS)</em> to speak quietly and in a low voice that is not easy to hear, often when you are worried or complaining about something: 嘀咕<br>Stop muttering and speak up!<br>He was muttering (away) to himself.<br>Laurence muttered something about his wife and left.<br>He muttered something under his breath to the person next to him.</li><li>stranded /ˈstræn.dɪd/: <em>adjective</em> unable to leave somewhere because of a problem such as not having any transportation or money: 进退两难的<br>He left me stranded downtown with no car and no money for a bus.<br>If the tide comes in, we’ll be stranded on these rocks.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do, like tapping the third <u>brick</u> on the left to get into Diagon Alley.

Harry watched, careful not to blink in case he missed it but just as the boy reached the dividing barrier between the two platforms, a large crowd of tourists came <u>swarming</u> in front of him and by the time the last <u>backpack</u> had cleared away, the boy had vanished.</p><blockquote><ul><li>swarm /swɔːrm/: <em>noun</em> a large group of insects all moving together: 人群<br>a swarm of bees/wasps/ants/locusts<br>The dead sheep was covered with swarms of flies.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/swarm_noun_002_36913.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of swarm"></p><ul><li>backpack /ˈbæk.pæk/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a large bag used to carry things on your back, used especially by people who go camping or walking:<br>It’s a frame backpack with a belt and padded shoulder straps.</li></ul><p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/backpa_noun_002_02242.jpg?version=5.0.184" alt="picture of backpack"></p></blockquote><p>“Fred, you next,” the plump woman said.</p><p>“I’m not Fred, I’m George,” said the boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

His twin called after him to hurry up, and he must have done so, because a second later, he had gone — but how had he done it?</p><p>Now the third brother was walking <u>briskly</u> toward the barrier he was almost there — and then, quite suddenly, he wasn’t anywhere.</p><blockquote><ul><li>brisk /brɪsk/: <em>adjective</em> quick, energetic, and active: 迅速的<br>a brisk walk<br>He set a brisk pace and we struggled to keep up.<br>Her tone on the phone was brisk (= she spoke quickly and used few words) and businesslike.</li></ul></blockquote><p>There was nothing else for it.</p><p>“Excuse me,” Harry said to the plump woman.</p><p>“Hello, dear,” she said. “First time at Hogwarts?

People <u>jostled</u> him on their way to platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going to <u>smash</u> right into that <u>barrier</u> and then he’d be in trouble — <u>leaning</u> forward on his cart, he broke into a heavy run — the barrier was coming nearer and nearer — he wouldn’t be able to stop the cart was out of control — he was a foot away — he closed his eyes ready for the crash — It didn’t come . . . he kept on running . . . he opened his eyes.</p><blockquote><ul><li>jostle /ˈdʒɑː.səl/: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to knock or push roughly against someone in order to move past them or get more space when you are in a crowd of people: 冲撞<br>As we came into the arena, we were jostled by fans pushing their way toward the stage.<br>Photographers jostled and shoved to get a better view of the royal couple.</li><li>smash /smæʃ/: <em>verb (MOVE FORCEFULLY)</em> to cause something to move with great force against something hard, usually causing damage or injury:<br>Several boats were smashed against the rocks during the storm.<br>He tried to smash the door down to get to me.<br>The car was traveling very fast when it smashed into the tree.<br>He threatened to smash my face in if I didn’t give him the money.</li><li>barrier /ˈber.i.ɚ/: <em>noun</em> a gate in some railroad stations through which you must go to get on a train: 站台<br>Passengers are requested to show their tickets at the barrier.</li><li>leaning: 倾斜</li></ul></blockquote><p>A <u>scarlet</u> steam engine was waiting next to a platform packed with people. A sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o’clock.

He finally tore his eyes away from the <u>Druidess Cliodna</u>, who was scratching her nose, to open a bag of Bertie Bott’s Every Flavor Beans.</p><blockquote><p>Morgana 莫佳娜<br>Hengist of Woodcroft 伍德克罗夫特的汉吉斯<br>Alberic Grunnion 阿博瑞克·格伦尼恩<br>Circe 瑟斯<br>Paracelsus 帕拉瑟<br>Merlin 梅林<br>Druidess Cliodna 德鲁伊特 克丽奥娜</p></blockquote><p>“You want to be careful with those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every <u>flavor</u>, they mean every flavor — you know, you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and <u>peppermint</u> and <u>mar-malade</u>, but then you can get <u>spinach</u> and <u>liver</u> and <u>tripe</u>.
