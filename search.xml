    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Coco"><a href="#Coco" class="headerlink" title="Coco"></a>Coco</h1><h2 id="Characters"><a href="#Characters" class="headerlink" title="Characters"></a>Characters</h2><h3 id="Miguel-Rivera"><a href="#Miguel-Rivera" class="headerlink" title="Miguel Rivera"></a>Miguel Rivera</h3><p>A smart and brave boy who was born in a shoemaker family. The whole family banned music while Miguel wanted to be an accomplished musician just like his great-great-grandfather. Along the way of chasing his dream, Miguel accidentally traveled the Land of the Dead and met the spirits of his families. A fantastic adventure began.</p>
<h3 id="Hector"><a href="#Hector" class="headerlink" title="Hector"></a>Hector</h3><p>A trickster who disguised himself as a famous artist. He was actually a kind and poor young man. He left his hometown and abandoned his family for his dream so that he was forgotten by his family and was going to disappear in the Land of the Dead. After meeting Miguel, he helped him a lot and encouraged Miguel by his humor.</p>
<h3 id="Ernesto-de-la-Cruz"><a href="#Ernesto-de-la-Cruz" class="headerlink" title="Ernesto de la Cruz"></a>Ernesto de la Cruz</h3><p>A welcomed musician. Each year on Día de los Muertos, he would put on a show to mark the end of the festival. However, there were many dirty secrets hidden behind his success.</p>
<h3 id="Coco-1"><a href="#Coco-1" class="headerlink" title="Coco"></a>Coco</h3><p>Miguel’s great-grandmother. She was an old lady who couldn’t remember many things any more. She missed her father and her childhood when the whole family often sang beautiful songs together. Finally, with the help of Miguel, she remembered her father again and left the Land of the Living happily.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-1"><a href="#Chapter-1" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 1"></a>Chapter 1</h2><p>Leaving the family home behind, Miguel breathed the <u>crisp</u> air of another sunny morning in Santa Cecilia.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>crisp /krɪsp/: <em>adjective (HARD)</em> hard enough to be broken easily</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>As he headed into town with his <u>shoeshine</u> box, he passed a woman sweeping a <u>stoop</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>shoeshine /ˈʃuːˌʃaɪn/:  n<ul>
<li>the act or an instance of polishing a pair of shoes</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>the appearance or shiny surface of polished shoes</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>stoop /stuːp/: <em>noun (STEPS)</em> to bend the top half of the body forward and down:<br>The doorway was so low that we had to stoop to go through it.<br>Something fell out of her coat pocket and she stooped down and picked it up.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/stoop_noun_002_36045.jpg?version=5.0.175" alt="picture of stoop"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She waved.</p>
<p>“Hola, Miguel!”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>hola : <em>informal</em>. （Spanish）hello</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Hola.” Miguel waved back.</p>
<p>Closer to town, Miguel smiled at a lone guitar player <u>plucking away at a song</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>pluck /plʌk/: <em>verb (REMOVE)</em> to pull something, especially with a sudden movement, in order to remove it:<br>Caged birds sometimes pluck out their breast feathers.<br>He plucked the letter from/out of my hand, and ran off with it.<br>Do you pluck your eyebrows (= remove some of the hairs from them to give them a better shape)?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The <u>farther</u> in Miguel went, the more music f illed the air.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>farther /ˈfɑːr.ðɚ/: <em>adverb</em> comparative of far : to a greater distance:<br>How much farther is it to the airport?<br>The fog’s so thick, I can’t see farther than about ten feet.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Church bells chimed in harmony. A band played an upbeat tune. A radio blared a swift cumbia rhythm.</p>
<p>Miguel soaked it all in.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help <u>tapping</u> out a beat on a table covered with brightly colored wooden animal <u>figurines</u>.</p>
<p>As Miguel rushed past another stand with <u>pastries</u> for sale, he grabbed a pan <u>dulce</u> and tossed the vendor a coin.</p>
<p>Smelling the sweet bread, Miguel’s canine <u>sidekick</u>, Dante, sidled up to him.</p>
<p>Miguel tore off a piece of the bread and Dante <u>chomped</u> it down.</p>
<p>Everywhere Miguel looked, people were preparing for their loved ones to return from the Land of the Dead by hanging colorful <u>papel</u> <u>picado</u> and laying <u>marigold</u> <u>petals</u> at their doorways.</p>
<p>As usual, Mariachi Plaza was full of musicians strolling around, waiting for their chance to serenade a couple or a family with a love song or a classic <u>corrido</u>.</p>
<p>Soon a tour group gathered around a large statue of a mariachi player in the center of the plaza.</p>
<p>“And right here, in this very plaza, the young Ernesto de la Cruz took his f irst steps toward becoming the most beloved singer in Mexican history,” said the guide.</p>
<p>Everyone in the group nodded, familiar with the legendary musician and singer.</p>
<p>Along with the tourists, Miguel gazed up at the statue.</p>
<p>He’d seen it a hundred times, but it always inspired him.</p>
<p>After a moment, Miguel found a spot in the plaza and pulled out his shoeshine box.</p>
<p>A mariachi plopped down for a shine.</p>
<p>Miguel knew the mariachi would enjoy this story.</p>
<p>After all, everyone loved Ernesto.</p>
<p>“He started out a total nobody from Santa Cecilia, like me,” said Miguel.</p>
<p>“But when he played music, he made people fall in love with him. He starred in movies. He had the coolest guitar. He could f ly!”</p>
<p>Miguel had seen that special effect in some old f ilm clips.</p>
<p>“And he wrote the best songs! But my all-time favorite? It’s—“</p>
<p>Miguel gestured to some musicians nearby, who were playing “Remember Me,” Ernesto’s biggest hit.</p>
<p>“He lived the kind of life you dream about. Until 1942, when he was crushed by a giant bell.”</p>
<p>The mariachi looked pointedly at his shoes, which Miguel was only halfheartedly shining.</p>
<p>Ignoring the musician, Miguel shrugged off Ernesto’s unfortunate death.</p>
<p>“I wanna be just like him. Sometimes I look at Ernesto and I get this feeling, like we’re connected somehow. Like if he could play music, maybe someday I can, too.”</p>
<p>Miguel sighed. “If it wasn’t for my family.”</p>
<p>“Ay-yi-yi, muchacho,” said the mariachi, snapping Miguel out of his story.</p>
<p>“Huh?” said Miguel.</p>
<p>“I asked for a shoeshine, not your life story,” replied the mariachi.</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, sorry.” Miguel lowered his head and polished the man’s shoe.</p>
<p>As he worked, the mariachi casually plucked at his guitar strings.</p>
<p>“I just can’t really talk about any of this at home, so—“</p>
<p>“Look, if I were you? I’d march right up to my family and say, ‘Hey! I’m a musician. Deal with it’. “</p>
<p>“I could never say that.”</p>
<p>“You ARE a musician, no?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I mean, I only really play for myself—“</p>
<p>“Ahh!” the mariachi howled.</p>
<p>“Did Ernesto de la Cruz become the world’s best musician by hiding his sweet, sweet skills? No! He walked out onto that plaza and he played out loud!”</p>
<p>The mariachi pointed to the gazebo, where a giant canvas that read talent show was being unfurled.</p>
<p>“Ah! Mira, mira! They’re setting up for tonight. The music competition for Día de los Muertos. You wanna be like your hero? You should sign up!”</p>
<p>“Uh-uh—my family would freak,” Miguel said.</p>
<p>“Look, if you’re too scared, then, well, have fun making shoes.”</p>
<p>The mariachi shrugged.</p>
<p>“C’mon, what did Ernesto de la Cruz always say?”</p>
<p>“‘Seize your moment’?” Miguel said.</p>
<p>The mariachi looked Miguel over and then offered him his guitar.</p>
<p>“Show me what you got, muchacho. I’ll be your f irst audience.”</p>
<p>Miguel’s eyebrows rose.</p>
<p>The mariachi really wanted to hear him play?</p>
<p>He glanced down the street to make sure the coast was clear of any family members.</p>
<p>He reached for the guitar.</p>
<p>Once it was cradled in his arms, Miguel spread his f ingers across the strings, anticipating his chord, and— “Miguel!” a familiar voice yelled.</p>
<p>Miguel gasped and threw the guitar back into the mariachi’s lap.</p>
<p>Abuelita marched toward him.</p>
<p>Tío Berto and Prima Rosa followed close behind with supplies from the market.</p>
<p>“Abuelita!” Miguel exclaimed.</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Um. . . uh. . . ,” Miguel stammered as he quickly packed away his shine rag and polishes.</p>
<p>Abuelita didn’t wait for Miguel’s answer.</p>
<p>She barreled up to the mariachi and struck him with her shoe.</p>
<p>“You leave my grandson alone!”</p>
<p>“Doña, please—I was just getting a shine!”</p>
<p>“I know your tricks, mariachi!” She glared at Miguel. “What did he say to you?”</p>
<p>“He was just showing me his guitar,” Miguel said sheepishly.</p>
<p>His family gasped.</p>
<p>“Shame on you!” Tío Berto barked at the mariachi.</p>
<p>Abuelita’s shoe was aimed directly at the area between the musician’s eyes.</p>
<p>“My grandson is a sweet little angelito querido cielito—he wants no part of your music, mariachi! You keep away from him!” she threatened.</p>
<p>Miguel wasn’t so sure he was the sweet little angel from heaven she’d described, but he wasn’t going to argue when she was gripping her shoe like that.</p>
<p>The mariachi scampered away, pulling on his hat before leaving.</p>
<p>Miguel watched apologetically over his abuelita’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Ay, pobrecito!”</p>
<p>Abuelita pulled her grandson protectively to her bosom.</p>
<p>“Estás bien, m’ijo?” Miguel gasped for air.</p>
<p>“You know better than to be here in this place! You will come home. Now!” she ordered, and turned away from the plaza.</p>
<p>Miguel sighed and gathered his shine box.</p>
<p>He spotted a plaza talent-show f lyer on the ground.</p>
<p>Behind his abuelita’s back, he snatched it up and put it in his pocket.</p>

    <title>OBS for Mac 多平台推送辅助工具开发笔记</title>
    <url>/posts/42237346.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="OBS-for-Mac-多平台推送辅助工具的开发笔记"><a href="#OBS-for-Mac-多平台推送辅助工具的开发笔记" class="headerlink" title="OBS for Mac 多平台推送辅助工具的开发笔记"></a>OBS for Mac 多平台推送辅助工具的开发笔记</h1><h2 id="开发环境"><a href="#开发环境" class="headerlink" title="开发环境"></a>开发环境</h2><p>本程序选择Go 语言的<code>fyne</code>框架完成 GUI 的设计。<br>主要具有三大块的功能: 1.配置文件操作 2. 使用<code>osascript</code>启动终端窗口运行命令 3. 配合ffmpeg完成多路推流功能。<br>而本文也将针对这三大块功能，依次展开的描述。</p>
<h2 id="配置文件读取"><a href="#配置文件读取" class="headerlink" title="配置文件读取"></a>配置文件读取</h2><p>这一部分功能是最简单的，在程序路径下创建一个配置文件，每次把新添加的推流路径追加到配置文件最后。配置路径的每一行对应一条推流路径。删除整个文件就实现了删除全部推流路径。</p>
<figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> fileName = <span class="string">&quot;.multi-push.conf&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">insert</span><span class="params">(newRTMP <span class="keyword">string</span>)</span></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	_, err := os.Stat(fileName)    <span class="comment">//os.Stat获取文件信息</span></span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">if</span> err != <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		<span class="keyword">if</span> !os.IsExist(err) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">			os.Create(fileName)</span><br><span class="line">		&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	f, err := os.OpenFile(fileName, os.O_WRONLY, <span class="number">0600</span>)</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">defer</span> f.Close()</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">if</span> err != <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		fmt.Println(err.Error())</span><br><span class="line">	&#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		n, _ := f.Seek(<span class="number">0</span>, os.SEEK_END)</span><br><span class="line">		<span class="comment">// 从末尾的偏移量开始写入内容</span></span><br><span class="line">		_, err = f.WriteAt([]<span class="keyword">byte</span>(newRTMP+<span class="string">&quot;\n&quot;</span>), n)</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">showAll</span><span class="params">()</span> <span class="title">string</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">var</span> contentByte []<span class="keyword">byte</span></span><br><span class="line">	f, err := os.OpenFile(fileName, os.O_CREATE,<span class="number">0600</span>)</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">defer</span> f.Close()</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">if</span> err !=<span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		fmt.Println(err.Error())</span><br><span class="line">		<span class="built_in">panic</span>(err)</span><br><span class="line">	&#125; <span class="keyword">else</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		contentByte,err=ioutil.ReadAll(f)</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">string</span>(contentByte)</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="调用终端窗口运行命令"><a href="#调用终端窗口运行命令" class="headerlink" title="调用终端窗口运行命令"></a>调用终端窗口运行命令</h2><p>这部分是这个程序最核心的部分，我选择使用命令创建一个新的终端窗口执行命令，这样做可以不阻塞整个程序的运行，同时也方便观察命令运行的效果。<br>执行命令的函数如下：</p>
<figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">exec_shell</span><span class="params">(s <span class="keyword">string</span>)</span> <span class="params">(<span class="keyword">string</span>)</span></span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	cmd := exec.Command(<span class="string">`osascript`</span>, <span class="string">&quot;-s&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;h&quot;</span>, <span class="string">&quot;-e&quot;</span>,<span class="string">`tell application &quot;Terminal&quot; to do script `</span>+s)</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">if</span> err := cmd.Run(); err != <span class="literal">nil</span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		fmt.Println(<span class="string">&quot;Error: &quot;</span>, err)</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">&quot;OK&quot;</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>一个使用上述函数安装 FFmpeg 的例子如下：</p>
<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">exec_shell(&quot;\&quot;brew install ffmpeg &amp;&amp; exit\&quot; &quot;)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="其他方面的总结"><a href="#其他方面的总结" class="headerlink" title="其他方面的总结"></a>其他方面的总结</h2><ol>
<li>使<code>fyne</code>支持中文显示<br><code>fyne</code>框架默认是不支持中文显示的，为了让<code>fyne</code>显示中文，需要在系统中创建一个环境变量<code>FYNE_FONT</code>，然后赋予中文字体路径。而这里遇到的问题是不同的系统中安装有不同的字体，只能通过不断的尝试，将大家都拥有的中文字体添加进去。这里我只写了两种常见的系统中文字体。具体的代码如下：</li>
</ol>
<p>在程序文件中添加下方的函数:</p>
<figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">func</span> <span class="title">init</span><span class="params">()</span></span> &#123;</span><br><span class="line">	fontPaths := findfont.List()</span><br><span class="line">	<span class="keyword">for</span> _, path := <span class="keyword">range</span> fontPaths &#123;</span><br><span class="line">		<span class="comment">// fmt.Println(path)</span></span><br><span class="line">		<span class="comment">//楷体:simkai.ttf</span></span><br><span class="line">		<span class="comment">//黑体:simhei.ttf</span></span><br><span class="line">		<span class="keyword">if</span> strings.Contains(path, <span class="string">&quot;STHeiti Light.ttc&quot;</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">			os.Setenv(<span class="string">&quot;FYNE_FONT&quot;</span>, path)</span><br><span class="line">			<span class="keyword">break</span></span><br><span class="line">		&#125;<span class="keyword">else</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> strings.Contains(path, <span class="string">&quot;simkai.ttf&quot;</span>) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">			os.Setenv(<span class="string">&quot;FYNE_FONT&quot;</span>, path)</span><br><span class="line">			<span class="keyword">break</span></span><br><span class="line">		&#125;</span><br><span class="line">	&#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>并且，在<code>main</code>函数的最后，添加下方的语句.</p>
<figure class="highlight go"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">_ = os.Unsetenv(<span class="string">&quot;FYNE_FONT&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<ol start="2">
<li>多平台推流命令<br>结合 FFmpeg 工具，我使用下方的命令实现多平台推流。<figure class="highlight plain"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">ffmpeg -re -i rtmp:&#x2F;&#x2F;127.0.0.1&#x2F;live&#x2F;HkJDIOgMd -acodec aac -vcodec h264 -flags +global_header -strict experimental -f tee -map 0:v -map 0:a &quot;[f&#x3D;flv]rtmp:&#x2F;&#x2F;live-push.bilivideo.com&#x2F;live-bvc&#x2F;?streamname&#x3D;XXXX&amp;key&#x3D;XXXX&amp;schedule&#x3D;rtmp | [f&#x3D;flv]rtmp:&#x2F;&#x2F;live-push.bilivideo.com&#x2F;live-bvc&#x2F;?streamname&#x3D;XXXX&amp;key&#x3D;XXXX&amp;schedule&#x3D;rtmp&quot;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
后面可以结合管道符不断追加直播地址，所有直播页面的内容都是同步推送的，延时很低。</li>

    <title>威尔莫特一致性指数 (WIA， Willmott’ s Index of Agreement)</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="威尔莫特一致性指数-WIA，-Willmott’-s-Index-of-Agreement"><a href="#威尔莫特一致性指数-WIA，-Willmott’-s-Index-of-Agreement" class="headerlink" title="威尔莫特一致性指数 (WIA， Willmott’ s Index of Agreement)"></a>威尔莫特一致性指数 (WIA， Willmott’ s Index of Agreement)</h1><h2 id="WIA介绍"><a href="#WIA介绍" class="headerlink" title="WIA介绍"></a>WIA介绍</h2><p>威尔莫特（1981）[1]提出了一个指数,是一种模型预测误差程度的标准化度量标准.</p>
<p>WIA 的取值在0到1之间。表示平均平方误差和潜在误差的比率。1表示估计值与实际值完全匹配，0表示估计值与实际值完全不匹配。</p>
<p>该指数可以检测观察到和模拟平均数和方差的加法和比例差异；然而，由于平方差分，d对极端值过于敏感。</p>
<p>WIA 可对单个模型的外部预测能力是否达到统计所需精度给出度量 ， 一般认为 WIA 大于 0.6 时模型才有实际预测价值。</p>
<h2 id="WIA-计算公式"><a href="#WIA-计算公式" class="headerlink" title="WIA 计算公式"></a>WIA 计算公式</h2><p>$$<br>WIA = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(O_i - P_i)^2 }{\sum_{i=1}^{n}( \left | P_i - \bar{O} \right | + \left | O_i - \bar{O} \right | )^2} , 0\leq WIA \leq1<br>$$</p>
<p>其中，O 表示观测值，P 表示预测值，$\bar{O}$表示平均观测值。上述公式中的平均观测值计算方法为：<br>$$<br>\bar{O} =\sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{O_i}{n}<br>$$</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="英文原文"><a href="#英文原文" class="headerlink" title="英文原文"></a>英文原文</h1><p>German Suspend the Use of the AstraZeneca COVID Vaccine</p>
<p>for the Under-60s</p>
<p>「World News」</p>
<p>Hello, I’m David Harper with the BBC News.The heads of Brazil’s army, navy and air force have resigned as President Jair Bolsonaro struggles to contain a crisis over his leadership. Mr. Bolsonaro was forced to reshuffle his cabinet on Monday, replacing the Defense and Foreign ministers. Here is our correspondent Will Grant.</p>
<p>The three men, General Edson Leal Pujol, Admiral Ilques Barbosa and Lieutenant-Brigadier Antonio Carlos Bermudes are furious over the way in which the previous Defense Minister was forced out. In what was believed to have been a fiery and hostile first meeting with his replacement, a Bolsonaro loyalist called Braga Netto, the military chiefs tended their resignations. It all amounts to the biggest political crisis President Bolsonaro has experienced since coming to office. Combined with his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic, the pressure on the right-wing leader has ramped up significantly in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has agreed to suspend the use of the AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine for the under-60s after the country’s vaccine committee said it had received reports of 31 cases of a rare type of blood clot, among more than 2.7 million people who received the jab. Jenny Hill is in Berlin. Angela Merkel said the decision was about trust, in which she said be wrong to sweep the very rare, but very serious cases under the carpet. Even so, the development presents a problem for the Chancellor who’s under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccination program as case numbers rise. </p>
<p>Mrs. Merkel acknowledged there would now be public concern around the vaccine, the development which may worry on the governments. The world Health Organization says that the vaccine is safe and the European Medicines Agency, which is still investigating the cases, has insisted that the benefits of the vaccine far outweigh the very low risks.</p>
<p>A judge in New York has sentenced the brother of the Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez to life in prison for trafficking drugs and possessing machine guns. Our correspondent Nada Twafic has this report. For more than a decade, Tony Hernandez trafficked more than 185 tons of cocaine into the United States by plane, boat and submarine. Some of the illegal drugs were apparently labeled with his initials.</p>
<p>US attorney said the former congressman used the proceeds in part to influence three presidential elections. His brother Juan Orlando Hernandez established himself as a champion in the fight against drugs, but prosecutors labeled him as a coconspirator who took millions of dollars in bribes from drug lords, including El Chapol. He has not been formally charged in the United States. Nada Twafic reporting.</p>

<p><strong>德国暂停为60岁以下人群接种阿斯利康疫苗</strong></p>
<p>Hello, I’m David Harper with the BBC News.The heads of Brazil’s army, navy and air force have resigned as President Jair Bolsonaro struggles to contain a crisis over his leadership. Mr. Bolsonaro was forced to reshuffle his cabinet on Monday, replacing the Defense and Foreign ministers. Here is our correspondent Will Grant.</p>
<p>就在巴西总统雅伊尔•博索纳罗艰难控制因其领导引发的危机时，陆海空三军领导人辞职。周一，博索纳罗被迫重组内阁，替换国防部长和外交部长。下面是本台记者维尔•格兰特发回的报道。</p>
<p>The three men, General Edson Leal Pujol, Admiral Ilques Barbosa and Lieutenant-Brigadier Antonio Carlos Bermudes are furious over the way in which the previous Defense Minister was forced out. In what was believed to have been a fiery and hostile first meeting with his replacement, a Bolsonaro loyalist called Braga Netto, the military chiefs tended their resignations. It all amounts to the biggest political crisis President Bolsonaro has experienced since coming to office. Combined with his mismanagement of the coronavirus pandemic, the pressure on the right-wing leader has ramped up significantly in recent weeks.</p>
<p>三军领袖爱迪生•莱亚尔•普若尔将军，伊利克斯•巴博萨海军上将和安东尼奥•卡洛斯•伯努德斯准将对前任国防部长被迫下台的方式感到愤怒。据称，忠于博索纳罗的新任国防部长布拉加•内托参加的第一次会议就剑拔弩张，军方领导人纷纷要求辞职。这些导致了总统博尔索纳罗上任以来出现的最大政治危机。加上他对新冠肺炎疫情的管理不善，这位右翼领导人的压力在最近几周明显增大。</p>

Even so, the development presents a problem for the Chancellor who’s under pressure to speed up a sluggish vaccination program as case numbers rise. </p>
<p>德国总理安格拉•默克尔同意暂停为60岁以下人群使用阿斯利康冠状病毒疫苗，此前该国疫苗委员会称270多万注射人群中出现了31例罕见血栓病例报告。请听珍妮•希尔在柏林的报道。安格拉•默克尔表示，这一决定关乎信任，将非常罕见但非常严重的病例掩盖起来是错误的。尽管如此，事态的发展给德国总理带来了问题，随着病例数量的增加，她面临着加速迟缓的疫苗接种计划的压力。</p>

<p>默克尔承认，现在疫苗引起了公众关注，事态发展可能会让政府感到担忧。世界卫生组织表示，该疫苗是安全的，仍在调查病例的欧洲药品管理局坚称，该疫苗的好处远远大于极低的风险。</p>

<p>「BBC World News」</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Chris Barrow with the BBC News.</p>
<p>The BBC has obtained a series of disturbing videos that appear to show the killing of unarmed civilians in Ethiopia’s northern Tigray region by people wearing Ethiopian army uniforms. The gunmen are heard speaking Amharic, Ethiopia’s official language, while the victims speak Tigrinya. Laetitia Bader is the Horn of Africa director for Human Rights Watch.Since the beginning of the conflict in the Tigray region, we’ve documented a whole magnitude of very serious abuses including extrajudicial executions by Ethiopian government forces and their allies. And this is absolutely an incident which would require further investigation, because what we are seeing here in the video could amount to war crimes.In response, the Ethiopian government has said social media posts and claims cannot be taken as evidence. The United Nations is investigating numerous allegations of atrocities.</p>
<p>The United Nations’ resident coordinator in Myanmar has told the BBC he fears the security situation in the country could get much worse. Andrew Kirkwood said evidence suggested the security forces were committed to the deliberate, coordinated and widespread use of lethal force.This week, I think it’s important to emphasize was the bloodiest week since the coup.So far, we’ve confirmed 538 people killed by the security forces and thousands more have been injured. Most of those in Yangon or Yangon and Mandalay, the two biggest cities. In fact, one in seven of all of those deaths are children under the age of 18 and some of them as young as five. And I think it’s also emphasizing the 90% of all of those deaths are from gunshots and the majority of those were bullets to the head, often by snipers and in broad daylight.</p>
<p>Politicians from all sides of the Dutch parliament have accused Mark Rutte of lying as the House debates a motion of no confidence in the long serving Prime Minister. The crisis arose on Thursday after documents showed that in coalition talks, Mr. Rutte had discussed a possible new job for a prominent member of parliament who had been critical of his previous cabinet. Mr. Rutte had previously said he did not do so.</p>
<p>Chile has closed its border for the month of April as it seeks to slow the spread of coronavirus. Health officials said a second wave had left hospitals close to collapse. Jane Chambers reports from Santiago.Only returning residents will be allowed into Chile for the next month. And most of the country is in full lockdown. The Chilean government hopes these measures will slow down the rate of infection. On Thursday, they announced the highest number of cases in one day for the whole of the pandemic. Around 35% of the population have already received their jab. But critics say that the government opened schools, malls and restaurants too early.</p>
<p>This has led to a spike in cases.</p>

The United Nations is investigating numerous allegations of atrocities.</p>
<p>BBC收到了一系列令人不安的视频，视频显示似乎有身穿埃塞俄比亚军装的人在埃塞俄比亚北部提格雷地区杀害手无寸铁的平民。从视频中可以听到枪手说的是埃塞俄比亚的官方语言阿姆哈拉语，而受害者说的是提格里尼亚语。莱蒂莎•贝德是人权观察组织的非洲之角主任。提格雷地区的冲突一开始，我们就记录了大量非常严重的凌虐行为，包括埃塞俄比亚政府军及其盟友的法外处决。该事件绝对需要进一步调查，因为我们在视频中看到的可能构成了战争罪。埃塞俄比亚政府回应称，社交媒体上的帖子和言论不能作为证据。联合国正在调查大量关于暴行的指控。</p>
<p>disturbing</p>
<p>单词：disturbing</p>
<p>表示“令人不安的”</p>
<p>英文解释为making you feel anxious and upset or shocked</p>
<p>举个🌰： </p>
<p><img src="/posts/4b10b6da/640.png" alt="img"></p>
<p>a whole magnitude of sth</p>
<p>magnitude表示“巨大”</p>
<p>英文解释为the great size or importance of sth; the degree to which sth is large or important</p>
<p>举个🌰：</p>
<p>I hadn’t realized the magnitude of the problem.</p>
<p>我没有认识到这个问题的重要性。</p>
<p>extrajudicial</p>
<p>表示“未按法律程序的”</p>
<p>英文解释为happening outside the normal power of the law </p>
<p>举个🌰：</p>
<p>UN investigator has called for the removal of Kenya’s police commissioner and attorney general over a wave of alleged extrajudicial killings.</p>
<p>一名联合国调查人员在许多所谓的法外处决上(已经)呼吁清除肯尼亚的警察署长和总检察长.</p>
<p>atrocities</p>
<p>表示“暴行”</p>
<p>英文解释为a cruel and violent act, especially in a war</p>
<p>举个🌰：</p>
<p>They were guilty of the most barbarous and inhuman atrocities.</p>
<p>他们犯有最野蛮、最灭绝人性的残暴罪行。</p>
<p>The United Nations’ resident coordinator in Myanmar has told the BBC he fears the security situation in the country could get much worse.

<p>联合国驻缅甸协调员告诉BBC，他担心该国的安全局势会变得更糟。安德鲁•柯克伍德表示，有证据表明，安全部队蓄意、协同并大量使用致命武器。本周，我认为有必要强调的是这是政变以来最血腥的一周。到目前为止，我们已经证实有538人被安全部队杀害，还有数千人受伤。被害者大部分在仰光，或者说在仰光和曼德勒这两个最大的城市。实际上，被害者中七分之一是18岁以下的儿童，其中一些只有5岁。还需要强调的是，90%的受害者都是中枪身亡，大多数是狙击手在光天化日之下瞄准头部开枪打死的。</p>
<p>deliberate</p>
<p>表示“故意的”</p>
<p>英文解释为done on purpose rather than by accident</p>
<p>举个🌰：</p>
<p>Are you deliberately trying to hurt me?</p>
<p>你是故意要让我难过吗？</p>
<p>Politicians from all sides of the Dutch parliament have accused Mark Rutte of lying as the House debates a motion of no confidence in the long serving Prime Minister. The crisis arose on Thursday after documents showed that in coalition talks, Mr. Rutte had discussed a possible new job for a prominent member of parliament who had been critical of his previous cabinet. Mr. Rutte had previously said he did not do so.</p>
<p>荷兰议会各方面政客都指责了马克•吕特撒谎，目前众议院正在辩论对这位长期任职首相的不信任动议。这场信任危机发生在周四，有文件显示，在联合政府的会谈中，吕特讨论了对一名曾批评其前内阁的著名议员提供新工作岗位的可能性。吕特此前曾表示，他没有这么做。</p>
<p>coalition</p>
<p>表示“联合政府”</p>
<p>英文解释为a government formed by two or more political parties working together </p>

<p>为了减缓冠状病毒的传播，智利在4月份关闭了边境。卫生官员表示，第二波疫情使医院几近崩溃。请听简•钱伯斯从圣地亚哥发回的报道。下个月只有回国的居民才允许进入智利。全国大部分地区都处于完全封锁状态。智利政府希望这些措施能降低感染率。周四，他们宣布了疫情爆发以来单日最多的病例数。智利大约35%的人口已经注射了疫苗。但批评人士指出，政府重启学校、购物中心和餐馆太早了。这导致了感染病例的激增。</p>

<h1 id="英文原文"><a href="#英文原文" class="headerlink" title="英文原文"></a>英文原文</h1><p>Former Policeman Who Accused of Killing George Floyd Is On Trial</p>
<p>「BBC World News」</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Neil Nunes with the BBC News.</p>
<p>The first day of the trial of the former policeman accused of killing George Floyd has ended in the US city of Minneapolis after both sides made their opening arguments. Derek Chauvin denies charges of manslaughter and murder. </p>
<p>The jury saw a new footage of him kneeling in Mr. Floyd’s neck for more than 9 minutes.The defendants argued that Mr. Floyd’s drug use and poor health led to his death. Here’s our North America editor Jon Sopel.</p>
<p>What’s unfolding in a courthouse in Minneapolis is not just about George Floyd and Derek Chauvin in many people’s eyes. This is American justice itself on trial.</p>
<p>America was convulsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests with demonstrations erupting in every city across the land. If Mr. Chauvin walks free, many will draw the conclusion that to the justice system, black lives don’t matter and that could be another dangerous flash point. The Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has replaced six cabinet ministers in the biggest reshuffle since he came to power just over 2 years ago. </p>
<p>The controversial Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo is among those sacked. Will Grant has more. Mr. Araujo repeatedly denied the effects of climate change and was in almost constant conflict with China, a long-standing economic partner. However, his resignation which was widely anticipated, was followed by the unexpected departure of the Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva.</p>
<p>That appeared to prompt the wider reshuffle by President Bolsonaro involving at least six ministries in total. Amid the changes, there also rumors in the media of serious rumblings among the top brass in all three branches of the military, stoking the sense of a major crisis in the Bolsonaro administration.</p>
<p>President Biden has implored US governors and mayors to continue to require people to wear face coverings in public. He said masks were crucial because reckless behavior was causing a rise in the number of coronavirus infections in the US.</p>
<p>As I do my part to accelerate the vaccine distribution of vaccinations, I need the American people do their part as well. Mask up！Mask up！It’s a patriotic duty. It’s the only way we ever get back to normal. Mr. Biden made the appeal after the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an emotional warning about the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari is traveling to London today for what his office described as a routine medical check. He’s expected to return home in the second week of April. A statement from the presidential spokesman gave no information on Mr. Buhari’s condition. One of his previous visits to the UK for treatment lasted more than 3 months.</p>

<p>The first day of the trial of the former policeman accused of killing George Floyd has ended in the US city of Minneapolis after both sides made their opening arguments.  Derek Chauvin denies charges of manslaughter and murder. </p>
<p>大家好，尼尔·努内斯为您播报BBC新闻。在美国明尼阿波利斯市，对被控杀害乔治·弗洛伊德的前警察的第一天审判已经结束，双方都进行了开庭辩论。德里克·肖万否认了过失杀人和谋杀的指控。</p>

<p>America was convulsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests with demonstrations erupting in every city across the land. If Mr. Chauvin walks free, many will draw the conclusion that to the justice system, black lives don’t matter and that could be another dangerous flash point.</p>
<p>去年，“黑人的命也是命”抗议活动震撼了美国，全国每个城市都爆发了示威活动。如果肖万无罪释放，许多人会得出这样的结论：对于司法系统来说，黑人的生命并不重要，这可能是又一个危险的导火索。</p>
<blockquote>

<p>表示“撼动”</p>
<p>英文解释为“if sth such as a war convulse a country, it causes a lot of problems or confusion”</p>
<p>举个🌰：A wave of nationalist demonstrations convulsed the country in 1919. 1919年，民族主义游行示威震动了该国。</p>

<blockquote>

However, his resignation which was widely anticipated, was followed by the unexpected departure of the Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva.</p>
<p>巴西总统雅伊尔·博索纳罗更换了6名内阁部长，这是他两年前上台以来最大规模的内阁改组。备受争议的外交部长埃内斯托·阿劳霍也被解职。请听威尔·格兰特的报道。阿劳霍曾多次否认气候变化的影响，而且几乎一直与长期的经济伙伴中国发生冲突。他的辞职是在意料之中的，但随后国防部长费尔南多·阿泽维多·席尔瓦的离职出乎人们的意料。</p>

</blockquote>
<p>That appeared to prompt the wider reshuffle by President Bolsonaro involving at least six ministries in total. Amid the changes, there also rumors in the media of serious rumblings among the top brass in all three branches of the military, stoking the sense of a major crisis in the Bolsonaro administration.</p>
<p>这似乎促使总统博索纳罗进行更广泛的重组，涉及至少六个部。媒体上也有传言称，军方所有三个部门的高级将领对这些变动议论纷纷，给博索纳罗政府增添了重大的危机感。</p>
<blockquote>

    <title>【NEWS精读】墨西哥新冠死亡人数猛增</title>
    <url>/posts/499346a6.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="英文原文"><a href="#英文原文" class="headerlink" title="英文原文"></a>英文原文</h1><p>COVID-19 in Mexico Climbs 60% Higher, Ranking 2nd in the Global List</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Justine Greene with the BBC News. The government of Mozambique says Islamist militants who began attacking the town of Palma on Wednesday have killed dozens of people.Thousands have fled the assault in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. A Defense Department spokesman Omar Saranga denied the military response had been slow. Here’s our Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga.</p>
<p>After days of silence that’s left many Mozambicans anxious, state security forces shed some light on the events unfolding in Palma. Mr. Omar Saranga said at least seven people were killed when their convoy came under fire as they tried to escape from the town.</p>
<p>The family of a South African man Adrian Nell confirmed he died in the ambush. There has been criticism of the army’s response to the attack in Palma.</p>
<p>Survivors’ talk of having to fend for themselves as they sought safety. New figures show the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in Mexico is 60% higher than previously thought. 320,000 Mexicans are thought to have died with the disease. Our correspondent Will Grant reports.</p>
<p>Having failed to produce excess death data for some time, a government report concluded that a little under 300,000 people died from the virus since the pandemic began until mid-February.</p>
<p>Combined with those who have since died from the illness, Mexico would be placed above Brazil and only behind the United States in the global list of COVID related deaths, despite having a far smaller population than both countries.</p>
<p>In part, the difficulty of obtaining a completely clear picture of the problem in Mexico comes from its low rate of testing. It is also believed that given the shortage of ICU beds in many states, a large number of people have died at home.</p>
<p>Mexico and Guatemala have announced a joint operation to deploy hundreds of troops and police along their border to prevent migrants from traveling North towards the United States. The authorities say that they are particularly concerned about the growing number of children and teenagers traveling without their parents in migrant caravans.</p>
<p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the country’s regional leaders to abide by a deal to impose tougher coronavirus restrictions as a third wave of infections gathers pace. Damien McGuinness reports.</p>
<p>Germany’s regional governments had agreed to an emergency break, meaning more lockdown restrictions if infection rates rise over a certain level. In much of Germany that rise has now happened, but some regional leaders are still not using that emergency break. That’s an infringement of the agreement, Mrs. Merkel said.</p>
<p>The Chancellor also criticized pilot schemes in some parts of the country aimed at opening everything up by requiring people to have a negative test on the day.</p>

<h1 id="全文解析"><a href="#全文解析" class="headerlink" title="全文解析"></a>全文解析</h1><p>墨西哥新冠死亡人数猛增60%至32万,超巴西居全球第二<br>COVID-19 in Mexico Climbs 60% Higher, Ranking 2nd in the Global List</p>
<p>Hello, I’m Justine Greene with the BBC News. The government of Mozambique says Islamist militants who began attacking the town of Palma on Wednesday have killed dozens of people.<br>大家好，我是贾斯汀·格林，欢迎收听BBC新闻。莫桑比克政府表示，伊斯兰极端武装分子周三开始袭击帕尔马镇，已造成数十人死亡。</p>
<p>Thousands have fled the assault in the northern province of Cabo Delgado. A Defense Department spokesman Omar Saranga denied the military response had been slow.<br>为躲避袭击，数千人已经逃离了北部德尔加多卡波省。莫桑比克国防部发言人奥马尔·萨兰加否认了军方反应迟缓。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flee<br>表示“迅速离开”，英文解释为“to leave a person or a place very quickly, especially because you are afraid of possible danger”<br>举个例子 ：many are fleeing violence in their homelands 很多移民是为了逃离家乡的暴力冲突。</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Here’s our Africa correspondent Catherine Byaruhanga. After days of silence that’s left many Mozambicans anxious, state security forces shed some light on the events unfolding in Palma. Mr. Omar Saranga said at least seven people were killed when their convoy came under fire as they tried to escape from the town.<br>请听本台驻非洲记者凯瑟琳·拜亚鲁汉加的报道。政府数天的沉默让许多莫桑比克人感到焦虑，现在国家安全部队已经披露了帕尔马袭击的一些事实。奥马尔·萨兰加表示，一个车队在逃离该镇的路上遭到袭击，至少7人丧生。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Unfold<br>表示“披露”，英文解释为“to be gradually made known; to gradually make sth known to other people”<br>举个例子 ：she unfolded her tale to us 她向我们倾吐了她的故事。</p>

<p>The family of a South African man Adrian Nell confirmed he died in the ambush. There has been criticism of the army’s response to the attack in Palma. Survivors’ talk of having to fend for themselves as they sought safety. New figures show the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 in Mexico is 60% higher than previously thought.<br>南非男子阿德里安·内尔的家人证实他在伏击中死亡。军队对帕尔马袭击事件的反应受到了批评。幸存者表示，他们在逃难的路上不得不自己保护自己。新的资料显示，墨西哥新冠肺炎相关死亡人数比之前的资料高出60%。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambush<br>表示“伏击”，英文解释为“the act of hiding and waiting for sb and then making a surprise attack on them”<br>举个 ：two soldiers were killed in a terrorist ambush两名士兵遭到恐怖分子伏击而死亡。</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fend for<br>表示“捍卫自己”，英文解释为“argue or speak in defence of ”同义词：defend, support.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>320,000 Mexicans are thought to have died with the disease. Our correspondent Will Grant reports. Having failed to produce excess death data for some time, a government report concluded that a little under 300,000 people died from the virus since the pandemic began until mid-February. Combined with those who have since died from the illness, Mexico would be placed above Brazil and only behind the United States in the global list of COVID related deaths, despite having a far smaller population than both countries.<br>有32万墨西哥人死于这种疾病。请听记者威尔·格兰特报道。政府很长时间以来未能提供非正常死亡资料，现在一份政府报告得出的结论是，自疫情开始至2月中旬，死于该病毒的人数略低于30万人。再加上截至现在的死亡人数，墨西哥的新冠病毒相关死亡人数将超过巴西，仅排在美国之后，尽管墨西哥的人口比这两个国家都少得多。</p>
<p>In part, the difficulty of obtaining a completely clear picture of the problem in Mexico comes from its low rate of testing. It is also believed that given the shortage of ICU beds in many states, a large number of people have died at home.<br>Mexico and Guatemala have announced a joint operation to deploy hundreds of troops and police along their border to prevent migrants from traveling North towards the United States. The authorities say that they are particularly concerned about the growing number of children and teenagers traveling without their parents in migrant caravans.<br>墨西哥新冠肺炎死亡人数不准确的部分原因是该国的检测率很低。其他原因还包括，墨西哥许多州缺乏重症监护病房，很多人死在家里。墨西哥和瓜地马拉宣布了一项联合行动， 在两国边境部署数百名士兵和警察，阻止非法移民向北前往美国。当局表示，他们尤其担心越来越多的儿童和青少年跟随移民车队来到这里。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Deploy<br>表示“部署”，英文解释为“to move soldiers or weapons into a position where they are ready for military action”如：2000 troops were deployed in the area那个地区部署了2000人的部队。</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The German Chancellor Angela Merkel has urged the country’s regional leaders to abide by a deal to impose tougher coronavirus restrictions as a third wave of infections gathers pace. Damien McGuinness reports.<br>随着第三波新冠病毒感染率上升，德国总理安格拉·默克尔敦促该国的地区领导人遵守一项协议，实施更严格的限制。请听达米安·麦吉尼斯的报道。</p>
<p>Germany’s regional governments had agreed to an emergency break, meaning more lockdown restrictions if infection rates rise over a certain level. In much of Germany that rise has now happened, but some regional leaders are still not using that emergency break. That’s an infringement of the agreement, Mrs. Merkel said.<br>The Chancellor also criticized pilot schemes in some parts of the country aimed at opening everything up by requiring people to have a negative test on the day.<br>默克尔还批评了该国一些地区的试点计划， 这些计划的目标是解除一切限制，仅需要人们在当天接受病毒阴性测试。</p>
<blockquote>

<h4 id="MPL中链式求导法则"><a href="#MPL中链式求导法则" class="headerlink" title="MPL中链式求导法则"></a>MPL中链式求导法则</h4><p>数学符号及对应公式的定义：</p>
<ul>
<li>误差$C = \sum_{j=0}^{n_L-1} (a_j^{(L)}-y_j)^2$</li>
<li>各神经元的中间变量$z_j^{(L)}=w_{kj}^{(L)}a_k^{(L-1)}+b_{k}^{(L)}$ ，其中，L代表层数，b代表偏置</li>
<li>进过激活函数后，各神经元的输出 $a_j^{(L)}=\sigma(z_j^{(L)})$</li>
</ul>
<p>根据上述定义，可以写出链式求导公式：<br>$$<br>\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_{kj}^{(L)}} =\sum_{j=0}^{n_L-1}   \frac{\partial z_j^{(L)}}{\partial w_{kj}^{(L)}} \frac{\partial a_j^{(L)}}{\partial z_j^{(L)}} \frac{\partial C_0}{\partial a_j^{(L)}}   \</p>
<p>\frac{\partial C}{\partial b_k^{(L)}} =\sum_{j=0}^{n_L-1}   \frac{\partial z_j^{(L)}}{\partial b_k^{(L)}} \frac{\partial a_j^{(L)}}{\partial z_j^{(L)}} \frac{\partial C_0}{\partial a_j^{(L)}}  \</p>

<h4 id="梯度下降"><a href="#梯度下降" class="headerlink" title="梯度下降"></a>梯度下降</h4><ul>
<li><p>梯度下降算法</p>
<p>根据损失函数计算得到误差，再计算损失函数对各个参数的导数，梯度下降算法就是沿着梯度的反方向移动一段步长，从而减小误差。</p>
<p>这种方法容易落到局部最优。且计算量较大，速度慢。</p>
</li>
<li><p>随机梯度下降算法</p>
<p>取一组minibatch，然后计算得到这一组的梯度，然后沿梯度方向下降。虽然下降的方向可能不够理想，但是计算量降低且计算速度加快。</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="卷积核"><a href="#卷积核" class="headerlink" title="卷积核"></a>卷积核</h4><p>各向同性微分算子是拉普拉斯算子。</p>
<h4 id="核心思想"><a href="#核心思想" class="headerlink" title="核心思想"></a>核心思想</h4><p>卷积神经网络处理图像的核心思路：提供给计算机某一图像数组后，使计算机能输出描述该图像属于某一特定分类的概率的数字。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>假设手电筒光可以覆盖 5 x 5 的区域，想象一下手电筒光照过输入图像的所有区域。在机器学习术语中，这束手电筒被叫做过滤器（filter，有时候也被称为神经元（neuron）或核（kernel）），被照过的区域被称为感受野（receptive field）。过滤器同样也是一个数组（其中的数字被称作权重或参数）</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>前馈运算（feed- forward 预测和推理）将高层语义信息逐层从原始数据的输入层中逐层抽象出来。</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>卷积</li>
<li>汇合</li>
<li>非线性激活函数</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>反馈运算（训练和学习）通过最后一层，将目标任务转化为目标函数，最后通过预测值与真实值之间的损失或误差，通过反向传播算法由最后一层逐层向前反馈，从而更新每一层的参数。</li>
</ol>
<p>接着重复前馈运算和反向传播算法，直到网络模型收敛，从而达到模型训练的目的。</p>
<h4 id="使用0填充边界"><a href="#使用0填充边界" class="headerlink" title="使用0填充边界"></a>使用0填充边界</h4><p><strong>使用0填充边界有以下好处</strong>：</p>
<p>（1）卷积了上一层之后的CONV层，没有缩小高度和宽度。 这对于建立更深的网络非常重要，否则在更深层时，高度/宽度会缩小。 一个重要的例子是“same”卷积，其中高度/宽度在卷积完一层之后会被完全保留。</p>
<p>（2）它可以帮助我们在图像边界保留更多信息。在没有填充的情况下，卷积过程中图像边缘的极少数值会受到过滤器的影响从而导致信息丢失。</p>
<h4 id="正则化"><a href="#正则化" class="headerlink" title="正则化"></a>正则化</h4><p>使用正则化来解决过拟合问题。</p>
<p>正则化在损失函数中引入模型复杂度指标，利用给W加权值，弱化了训练数据中的噪声。</p>
<h5 id="L1正则化"><a href="#L1正则化" class="headerlink" title="L1正则化"></a>L1正则化</h5><p><strong>直接在原来的损失函数基础上加上权重参数的绝对值</strong>。假设待正则的网络层参数为w，L1正则化为：</p>
<p>$L = E_{in}+\lambda\sum_{j}|w_j|$</p>
<p>L1正则化除了同L2正则化一样能约束参数量级外，L1正则化还可以使得参数更稀疏，使得优化后的参数的一部分为0，另一部分为非0实值。</p>
<h5 id="L2正则化"><a href="#L2正则化" class="headerlink" title="L2正则化"></a>L2正则化</h5><p><strong>直接在原来的损失函数基础上加上权重参数的平方和</strong>。假设待正则的网络层参数为w，l2正则化形式为：</p>
<p>$L=E_{in}+\lambda\sum_{j}w_j^2$</p>
<p>其中，Ein 是未包含正则化项的训练样本误差，λ控制正则项大小，较大的λ取值将较大程度约束模型复杂度；反之亦然。实际使用时，一般将正则项加入目标函数（损失函数），通过整体目标函数的误差反向传播，从而达到正则项影响和指导网络训练的目的。</p>
<p>L2正则化在深度学习中有一个常用的叫法是“权重衰减”，另外L2正则化在机器学习中还被称为“岭回归”或Tikhonov正则化。</p>

<p>对于个人投资者而言,如果你所拥有的资金数额不足以买入一系列不同类型的股票和债券,或者你根本没有时间和精力去挑选股票和债券,那么购买基金就是个不错的选择。</p>
<h2 id="“基金估值”是什么？"><a href="#“基金估值”是什么？" class="headerlink" title="“基金估值”是什么？"></a>“基金估值”是什么？</h2><p>基金估值是指按照公允价格对基金资产和负债的价值进行计算、评估，以确定基金资产净值和基金份额净值的过程。</p>
<p>基金估值一般是由基金销售机构公布。它与基金净值不同，所谓估值就是估计参考的意思。基金销售机构是通过模拟的方式预估净值涨幅，它的数值是实时更新的。<br>基金净值：</p>
<p>是指每个营业日根据基金所投资证券市场收盘价所计算出的基金总资产价值，扣除基金当日之各类成本及费用后，所得到的就是该基金当日之资产净值。除以基金当日所发生在外的单位总数，就是每单位基金净值。</p>
<p>基金净值一般会在当天交易日结束的晚上公布，这项数据是真实可信的。当然基金净值的公布时间也有例外，由于海外市场与我们有时差，所以QDII类型基金是T+2公布基金净值。<br>基金份额：</p>
<p>是指基金发起人向投资者公开发行的，表示持有人按其所持份额对基金财产享有收益分配权、清算后剩余财产取得权和其他相关权利，并承担相应义务的凭证。</p>

They were the last people you’d expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn’t <em>hold with(相信)</em> such <em>nonsense(歪门邪道)</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dursley一家都很规矩，不相信奇怪的事。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dursley was the <em>director(主管)</em> of a firm called Grunnings, which made <em>drills(钻头)</em> . He was a big, beefy<em>(结实的)</em> man with <em>hardly any neck(几乎没有脖子)</em>, although he did have a very large <em>mustache(胡子)</em> . Mrs. Dursley was thin and <em>blonde(金发碧眼的)</em> and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time <em>craning over(伸长脖子)</em> garden <em>fences(栅栏)</em> , <em>spying(窥探)</em> on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a small son called Dudley and in their opinion there was no <em>finer(更好的)</em> boy anywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dursley先生短脖子大胡子，是一家钻机厂的主管，夫人金发碧眼，喜欢偷窥邻里。溺爱孩子Dudley。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had a secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it.</p>
<p>They didn’t think they could <em>bear(承受)</em> it if anyone found out about the Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t met for several years; in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have a sister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as <em>unDursleyish(和Dursley一家完全不同)</em> as it was possible to be. The Dursleys <em>shuddered(胆战心惊)</em> to think what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in the street. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason for keeping the Potters away; they didn’t want Dudley mixing with a child like that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dursley夫人是Potter夫人的姐姐，但是Dursley一家不喜欢Potter一家。更不想他们的儿子Dudley与Harry Potter 厮混。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the <em>dull(阴暗的,迟钝的,无趣的)</em>, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley <em>hummed(哼着小曲)</em> as he picked out his most boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley <em>gossiped(絮絮叨叨)</em> away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dursley先生好的领带不戴，偏得挑一个最不喜欢的领带戴着去上班。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>None of them noticed a large, <em>tawny(黄褐色的)</em> <em>owl(猫头鹰)</em> <em>flutter(挥着翅膀)</em> past the window.</p>
<p>At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his <em>briefcase(公文包)</em>, <em>pecked(轻吻,啄)</em> Mrs. Dursley on the <em>cheek(脸颊)</em>, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a <em>tantrum(小孩耍脾气)</em> and throwing his <em>cereal(麦片)</em> at the walls. “Little <em>tyke(小孩子;小淘气;小调皮鬼)</em> ,” <em>chortled(开怀大笑)</em> Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of number four’s drive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>达力大早上闹小脾气，乱扔东西，一点儿都不省心，他爸他妈还惯着他。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar — a cat reading a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley didn’t realize what he had seen — then he <em>jerked(扭头，回头)</em> his head around to look again. There was a <em>tabby(花斑的)</em> cat standing on the corner of Privet Drive, but there wasn’t a map in sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been a <em>trick(恶作剧;骗局)</em> of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr. Dursley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in his mirror. It was now reading the sign that said Privet Drive — no, looking at the sign; cats couldn’t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind. As he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of <em>drills(钻头)</em> he was hoping to get that day.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>弗农大早上撞见鬼，不不不，是撞见猫在读路标。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by something else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic <em>jam(拥堵)</em>, he couldn’t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about. People in <em>cloaks(斗篷)</em> . Mr. Dursley couldn’t bear people who dressed in funny clothes — the <em>getups(穿戴)</em> you saw on young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He <em>drummed(有节奏地敲击)</em> his fingers on the <em>steering wheel(方向盘)</em> and his eyes fell on a huddle of these <em>weirdos(古怪的)</em> standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them weren’t young at all; why, that man had to be older than he was, and wearing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly <em>stunt(噱头)</em> — these people were obviously collecting for something . . . yes, that would be it. The traffic moved on and a few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived in the Grunnings parking lot, his mind back on drills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>路上堵车，弗农遇到一群穿奇装异服的人，然后他就很不能理解，甚至咒骂他们。<br>思维古板的人看到自己无法理解的事情，会用自己的思维模式去理解。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor. If he hadn’t, he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning. He didn’t see the owls swooping past in <em>broad daylight(光天化日)</em>, though people down in the street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead. Most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had a perfectly normal, <em>owl-free(没有受到猫头鹰干扰)</em> morning. He yelled at five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more. He was in a very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he’d stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a <em>bun(圆面包)</em> from the <em>bakery(面包店)</em>.</p>
<p>He’d forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker’s. He eyed them angrily as he passed. He didn’t know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn’t see a single <em>collecting tin(募捐箱)</em>. It was on his way back past them, <em>clutching(抓住)</em>a large <em>doughnut(油炸圈饼)</em>in a bag, that he caught a few words of what they were saying.</p>
<p>“The Potters, that’s right, that’s what I heard —”</p>
<p>“— yes, their son, Harry —”</p>
<p>Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but thought <em>better(打断)</em> of it.</p>
<p>He <em>dashed(猛冲)</em> back across the road, hurried up to his office, snapped at his <em>secretary(秘书)</em> not to disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking . . . no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn’t such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots of people called Potter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn’t even sure his <em>nephew(侄子)</em> was called Harry. He’d never even seen the boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset at any mention of her sister. He didn’t <em>blame(责备)</em> her — if he’d had a sister like that . . . but all the same, those people in cloaks . . .</p>
<blockquote>
<p>看到穿斗篷的人们在议论哈利，德思礼的心理活动由不解到愤怒，到不相信到自我麻痹和自我安慰。都说明了德思礼内心对哈利的抵触，以及对有关哈利的一切消息的防备。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five o’clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” he <em>grunted(嘟哝)</em>, as the tiny old man <em>stumbled(绊脚)</em> and almost fell. It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man was wearing a <em>violet(紫罗兰)</em> cloak. He didn’t seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground. <em>On the contrary(相反的)</em>, his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don’t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! <em>Rejoice(太高兴了)</em>, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”</p>
<p>And the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and walked off.</p>
<p>Mr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a complete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, whatever that was. He was <em>rattled(慌乱地)</em>. He hurried to his car and set off for home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn’t approve of imagination.</p>
<p>As he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he saw — and it didn’t improve his mood — was the tabby cat he’d spotted that morning. It was now sitting on his garden wall. He was sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its eyes.</p>
<p>“Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.<br>The cat didn’t move. It just gave him a <em>stern(狠狠地)</em> look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying to pull himself together, he let himself into the house. He was still <em>determined(坚定地)</em> not to mention anything to his wife.</p>
<p>Mrs. Dursley had had a nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all about Mrs. Next Door’s problems with her daughter and how Dudley had learned a new word (“Won’t!”). Mr. Dursley tried to act normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news:</p>
<p>“And finally, bird-watchers everywhere have reported that the nation’s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally <em>hunt(捕食)</em> at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since <em>sunrise(黎明)</em>. Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” The newscaster allowed himself a <em>grin(咧嘴笑)</em>. “Most mysterious. And now, over to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more <em>showers(阵雨)</em> of owls tonight, Jim?”</p>
<h2 id="1-1-2-Shooting-stars-are-reported遍布流星"><a href="#1-1-2-Shooting-stars-are-reported遍布流星" class="headerlink" title="1-1-2 Shooting stars are reported遍布流星"></a>1-1-2 Shooting stars are reported遍布流星</h2><p>“Well, Ted,” said the weatherman, “I don’t know about that, but it’s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as far apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they’ve had a downpour of shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early — it’s not until next week, folks! But I can promise a wet night tonight.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dursley sat frozen in his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? And a whisper, a whisper about the Potters . . .<br>Mrs. Dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea. It was no good. He’d have to say something to her. He cleared his <em>throat(喉咙)</em> nervously. “Er — Petunia, dear — you haven’t heard from your sister lately, have you?”</p>
<p>As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn’t have a sister.</p>
<p>“No,” she said sharply. “Why?”</p>
<p>“Funny stuff on the news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls . . . shooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .”</p>
<p>“So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.</p>
<p>“Well, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do with . . . you know . . . her crowd.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Dursley <em>sipped(抿)</em> her tea through <em>pursed(皱)</em> <em>lips(嘴唇)</em>. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he <em>dared(敢于)</em> tell her he’d heard the name “Potter.” He decided he didn’t dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could, “Their son — he’d be about Dudley’s age now, wouldn’t he?”</p>
<p>“I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.</p>
<p>“What’s his name again? Howard, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Harry. <em>Nasty(肮脏的)</em>, common name, if you ask me.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart <em>sinking(沉默)</em> <em>horribly(可怕的)</em>. “Yes, I quite agree.”</p>
<p>He didn’t say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed. While Mrs. Dursley was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley <em>crept(匍匐爬行)</em> to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden. The cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive as though it were waiting for something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>德思礼害怕在佩妮面前提起她的妹妹，而且晚上本来应该下雨，却下了流星雨，白天猫头鹰四散纷飞，穿斗篷的人议论哈利，以及花园栅栏上那只一动不动望着路口的猫，都说明这是不平常的一天，暗示接下来会有更加奇怪的事情发生。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything to do with the Potters? If it did . . . if it got out that they were related to a pair of — well, he didn’t think he could bear it.</p>
<p>The Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the Potters were involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and Mrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . . He couldn’t see how he and Petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on — he yawned and turned over — it couldn’t affect them. . . .</p>
<p>How very wrong he was.</p>
<p>Mr. Dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep, but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness. It was sitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of Privet Drive. It didn’t so much as <em>quiver(抖动)</em> when a car door slammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. In fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all.</p>
<p>A man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you’d have thought he’d just popped out of the ground. The cat’s <em>tail(尾巴)</em> <em>twitched(抖动)</em> and its eyes <em>narrowed(变窄)</em>.</p>
<p>Nothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by the silver of his hair and beard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was wearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, <em>buckled(有扣的)</em> <em>boots(靴子)</em>. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half-moon <em>spectacles(眼镜)</em> and his nose was very long and <em>crooked(歪的)</em>, as though it had been broken at least twice. This man’s name was Albus Dumbledore.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Albus Dumbledore didn’t seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome. He was busy <em>rummaging(翻找)</em> in his cloak, looking for something. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly at the cat, which was still staring at him from the other end of the street. For some reason, the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him. He <em>chuckled(轻声地笑)</em> and muttered, “I should have known.”</p>
<p>He found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up in the air, and clicked it. The nearest street <em>lamp(灯)</em> went out with a little pop. He clicked it again — the next lamp flickered into darkness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, which were the eyes of the cat watching him. If anyone looked out of their window now, even <em>beady-eyed(眼尖的)</em> Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn’t be able to see anything that was happening down on the <em>pavement(人行道)</em>. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the wall next to the cat. He didn’t look at it, but after a moment he spoke to it.</p>
<p>“<em>Fancy seeing you here(真没想到在这儿遇见您)</em>, Professor McGonagall.”</p>
<p>He turned to smile at the <em>tabby(斑猫)</em>, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling at a rather severe-looking woman who was wearing <em>square(方形)</em> glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an <em>emerald(翠绿)</em> one. Her black hair was drawn into a tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“How did you know it was me?” she asked.</p>
<p>“My dear Professor, I’ve never seen a cat sit so <em>stiffly(僵硬)</em>.”</p>
<p>“You’d be stiff if you’d been sitting on a <em>brick(砖)</em> wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, everyone’s celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You’d think they’d be a bit more careful, but no — even the Muggles have noticed something’s going on. It was on their news.” She jerked her head back at the Dursleys’ dark living-room window. “I heard it. Flocks of owls . . . shooting stars. . . . Well, they’re not completely stupid. They were bound to notice something. Shooting stars down in Kent — I’ll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>迪歌出现，麦格教授认为是他让肯特郡(Kent)下流星雨。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“You can’t blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We’ve had precious little to celebrate for eleven years.”</p>
<p>“I know that,” said Professor McGonagall <em>irritably(急躁的)</em>. “But that’s no reason to lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out on the streets in broad daylight, not even dressed in Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”</p>
<p>She threw a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore here, as though hoping he was going to tell her something, but he didn’t, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, on the very day You-Know-Who seems to have disappeared at last, the Muggles found out about us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>“It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much to be thankful for. Would you care for a lemon drop?”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“A lemon drop. They’re a kind of Muggle sweet I’m rather fond of.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>邓布利多教授喜欢吃柠檬味硬糖(lemon drop)。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, as though she didn’t think this was the moment for lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone —”</p>
<p>“My dear Professor, surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who’ nonsense — for eleven years I have been trying to <em>persuade(说服)</em> people to call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall <em>flinched(寒颤)</em>, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not to notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.’ I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort’s name.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>伏地魔出现。他的名字其他人都很避讳，都称他为“神秘人”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I know you haven’t,” said Professor McGonagall, sounding half <em>exasperated(激怒)</em>, half <em>admiring(赞赏)</em>. “But you’re different. Everyone knows you’re the only one You-Know- oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”</p>
<p>“You <em>flatter(抬举)</em> me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”</p>
<p>“Only because you’re too — well — <em>noble(高贵)</em> to use them.”</p>
<p>“It’s lucky it’s dark. I haven’t blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new <em>earmuffs(护耳)</em>.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall shot a sharp look at Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next to the <em>rumors(谣言)</em> that are flying around. You know what everyone’s saying? About why he’s disappeared? About what finally stopped him?”</p>
<p>It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss, the real reason she had been waiting on a cold, hard wall all day, for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed Dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going to believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.</p>
<p>“What they’re saying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric’s Hollow. He went to find the Potters. The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are — are — that they’re — dead.”</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.</p>
<p>“Lily and James . . . I can’t believe it . . . I didn’t want to believe it . . . Oh, Albus . . .”</p>
<p>Dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder. “I know . . . I know . . .” he said heavily.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall’s voice trembled as she went on. “That’s not all. They’re saying he tried to kill the Potters’ son, Harry. But — he couldn’t. He couldn’t kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they’re saying that when he couldn’t kill Harry Potter, Voldemort’s power somehow broke — and that’s why he’s gone.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore nodded <em>glumly(忧郁的)</em>.</p>
<p>“It’s — it’s true?” <em>faltered(颤抖)</em> Professor McGonagall. “After all he’s done . . . all the people he’s killed . . . he couldn’t kill a little boy? It’s just <em>astounding(震惊)</em> . . . of all the things to stop him . . . but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive?”</p>
<p>“We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace <em>handkerchief(手帕)</em> and <em>dabbed(抹)</em> at her eyes <em>beneath(在……下方)</em> her <em>spectacles(眼镜)</em>. Dumbledore gave a <em>great sniff(深呼吸)</em> as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it. It was a very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around the edge. It must have made sense to Dumbledore, though, because he put it back in his pocket and said, “Hagrid’s late. I suppose it was he who told you I’d be here, by the way?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don’t suppose you’re going to tell me why you’re here, of all places?”</p>
<p>“I’ve come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle. They’re the only family he has left now.”</p>
<p>“You don’t mean — you can’t mean the people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping to her feet and pointing at number four. “Dumbledore — you can’t. I’ve been watching them all day. You couldn’t find two people who are less like us. And they’ve got this son — I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street, screaming for sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”</p>
<p>“It’s the best place for him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he’s older. I’ve written them a letter.”</p>
<p>“A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down on the wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this in a letter? These people will never understand him! He’ll be famous — a legend — I wouldn’t be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter Day in the future — there will be books written about Harry — every child in our world will know his name!”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over the top of his half-moon glasses. “It would be enough to turn any boy’s head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous for something he won’t even remember! Can’t you see how much better off he’ll be, growing up away from all that until he’s ready to take it?”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes — yes, you’re right, of course. But how is the boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.</p>
<p>“Hagrid’s bringing him.”</p>
<p>“You think it — wise — to trust Hagrid with something as important as this?”</p>
<p>“I would trust Hagrid with my life,” said Dumbledore.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying his heart isn’t in the right place,” said Professor McGonagall <em>grudgingly(勉强的)</em>, “but you can’t pretend he’s not careless. He does tend to — what was that?”</p>

It grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight; it <em>swelled to a roar(怒吼)</em> as they both looked up at the sky — and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them.</p>
<p>If the motorcycle was huge, it was nothing to the man sitting astride it. He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so wild — long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face, he had hands the size of trash can lids, and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins. In his vast, muscular arms he was holding a bundle of <em>blankets(毛毯)</em>.</p>

<p>“Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”</p>
<p>“Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said the giant, climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it to me. I’ve got him, sir.”</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>“No problems, were there?” “No, sir — house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin’ around. He fell asleep as we was flyin’ over Bristol.”</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy, fast asleep. Under a tuft of jet-black hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut, like a bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>“Is that where — ?” whispered Professor McGonagall.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He’ll have that scar forever.”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t you do something about it, Dumbledore?”</p>
<p>“Even if I could, I wouldn’t. Scars can come in handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground. Well — give him here, Hagrid — we’d better get this over with.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>邓布利多左膝盖的伤疤是伦敦地铁图</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dumbledore took Harry in his arms and turned toward the Dursleys’ house.</p>
<p>“Could I — could I say good-bye to him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been a very <em>scratchy(粗糙的)</em>, <em>whiskery(有胡须的)</em> kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog.</p>
<p>“Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you’ll wake the Muggles!”</p>
<p>“S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out a large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it. “But I c-c-can’t stand it — Lily an’ James dead — an’ poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles —”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, it’s all very sad, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, or we’ll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly on the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door. He laid Harry gently on the doorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry’s blankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle; Hagrid’s shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked <em>furiously(疯狂的)</em>, and the twinkling light that usually shone from Dumbledore’s eyes seemed to have gone out.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that’s that. We’ve no business staying here. We may as well go and join the celebrations.”</p>
<p>“Yeah,” said Hagrid in a very muffled voice, “I’d best get this bike away. G’night, Professor McGonagall — Professor Dumbledore, sir.”</p>
<p>Wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life; with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night.</p>
<p>“I <em>shall(将)</em> see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding to her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose in reply.</p>
<p>Dumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the corner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. He could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利被放在第四个台阶上。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak, he was gone.</p>
<p>A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours’ time by Mrs. Dursley’s scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He couldn’t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices: “To Harry Potter — the boy who lived!”</p>

    <title>Harry Potter 1-2 THE VANISHING GLASS</title>
    <url>/posts/5d4f2984.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-2-THE-VANISHING-GLASS"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-2-THE-VANISHING-GLASS" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-2 THE VANISHING GLASS"></a>Harry Potter 1-2 THE VANISHING GLASS</h1><h2 id="1-The-vanishing-glass-消失的玻璃"><a href="#1-The-vanishing-glass-消失的玻璃" class="headerlink" title="1 The vanishing glass 消失的玻璃"></a>1 The vanishing glass 消失的玻璃</h2><p>Nearly ten years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their <em>nephew(外甥)</em> on the front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the <em>brass(黄铜)</em> number four on the Dursleys’ front door; it crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that <em>fateful(重大的)</em> news report about the <em>owls(猫头鹰)</em>. Only the photographs on the <em>mantelpiece(火炉)</em> really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets — but Dudley Dursley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large <em>blond(皮肤白皙的)</em> boy riding his first bicycle, on a <em>carousel(旋转木马)</em> at the <em>fair(展览会)</em>, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house, too.</p>
<p>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her <em>shrill(尖锐的)</em> voice that made the first noise of the day.</p>
<p>“Up! Get up! Now!”</p>
<p>Harry woke with a start. His aunt <em>rapped(拍打)</em> on the door again.</p>
<p>“Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the <em>frying pan(煎锅)</em> being put on the <em>stove(火炉)</em>. He rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having. It had been a good one. There had been a flying motorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he’d had the same dream before.</p>
<p>His aunt was back outside the door.</p>
<p>“Are you up yet?” she <em>demanded(要求)</em>.</p>
<p>“Nearly,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Well, get a move on, I want you to look after the <em>bacon(熏肉)</em>. And don’t you <em>dare(胆敢)</em> let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy’s birthday.”</p>
<p>Harry <em>groaned(咕哝)</em>.</p>
<p>“What did you say?” his aunt snapped through the door.</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing . . .”</p>
<p>Dudley’s birthday — how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for <em>socks(袜子)</em>. He found a pair under his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them on. Harry <em>was used to(习惯于)</em> spiders, because the <em>cupboard(橱柜)</em> under the stairs was full of them, and that was where he slept.</p>
<p>When he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen. The table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley’s birthday presents. It looked as though Dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted, not to mention the second television and the racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very fat and hated exercise — unless of course it involved <em>punching(拳打)</em> somebody. Dudley’s favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn’t often catch him. Harry didn’t look it, but he was very fast.</p>
<p>Perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark <em>cupboard(橱柜)</em>, but Harry had always been small and <em>skinny(皮包骨的)</em> for his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of Dudley’s, and Dudley was about four times bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, <em>knobbly(多疙瘩的)</em> knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together with a lot of Scotch <em>tape(胶带)</em> because of all the times Dudley had punched him on the nose. The only thing Harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could remember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利形象: 瘦弱的，膝盖骨突出，黑色头发，绿色眼睛，带圆框眼睛。</p>
<p>Scotch: 透明胶带的商标名</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“In the car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don’t ask questions.”</p>
<p>Don’t ask questions — that was the first rule for a quiet life with the Dursleys.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon entered the kitchen as Harry was turning over the bacon.</p>
<p>“<em>Comb(梳理)</em> your hair!” he barked, by way of a morning greeting.</p>
<p>About once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed a haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way — all over the place.</p>
<p>Harry was <em>frying(油炸)</em> eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and <em>thick(浓密的)</em> blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like a baby angel — Harry often said that Dudley looked like a pig in a <em>wig(假发)</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>达力形象: 粉色大脸，蓝色眼睛，短脖子，浓密的金发贴在胖乎乎的脑袋上，哈利觉得像只戴假发的猪。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was difficult as there wasn’t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.</p>
<p>“Thirty-six,” he said, looking up at his mother and father. “That’s two less than last year.”</p>
<p>“Darling, you haven’t counted Auntie Marge’s present, see, it’s here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.”</p>
<p>“All right, thirty-seven then,” said Dudley, going red in the face. Harry, who could see a huge Dudley <em>tantrum(发怒)</em> coming on, began <em>wolfing down(狼吞虎咽)</em> his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia obviously <em>scented(嗅到了)</em> danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we’ll buy you another two presents while we’re out today. How’s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”</p>
<p>Dudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I’ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .”</p>
<p>“Thirty-nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>“Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and <em>grabbed(抓住)</em> the nearest <em>parcel(包裹)</em>. “All right then.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon <em>chuckled(轻笑)</em>.</p>
<p>“Little tyke wants his money’s worth, just like his father. ’<em>Atta boy(好小子)</em>, Dudley!” He <em>ruffled(揉)</em> Dudley’s hair.</p>
<p>At that moment the telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went to answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley <em>unwrap(打开)</em> the racing bike, a video camera, a remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and a VCR. He was ripping the paper off a gold <em>wristwatch(手表)</em> when Aunt Petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried.</p>
<p>“Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg’s broken her leg. She can’t take him.” She jerked her head in Harry’s direction.</p>
<p>Dudley’s mouth fell open in <em>horror(惊骇)</em>, but Harry’s heart gave a <em>leap(跳跃)</em>. Every year on Dudley’s birthday, his parents took him and a friend out for the day, to <em>adventure(冒险)</em> parks, hamburger restaurants, or the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a <em>mad(疯)</em> old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. The whole house smelled of <em>cabbage(卷心菜)</em> and Mrs. Figg made him look at photographs of all the cats she’d ever owned.</p>
<p>“Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking <em>furiously(狂怒的)</em> at Harry as though he’d planned this. Harry knew he ought to feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn’t easy when he reminded himself it would be a whole year before he had to look at Tibbies, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.</p>
<p>“We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.</p>
<p>“Don’t be silly, Vernon, she hates the boy.”</p>
<p>The Dursleys often spoke about Harry like this, as though he wasn’t there — or rather, as though he was something very nasty that couldn’t understand them, like a <em>slug(鼻涕虫)</em>.</p>
<p>“What about what’s-her-name, your friend — Yvonne?”</p>
<p>“On vacation in Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.</p>
<p>“You could just leave me here,” Harry put in hopefully (he’d be able to watch what he wanted on television for a change and maybe even have a go on Dudley’s computer).</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia looked as though she’d just <em>swallowed(咽下)</em> a lemon.</p>
<p>“And come back and find the house in <em>ruins(废墟)</em>?” she <em>snarled(咆哮)</em>.</p>
<p>“I won’t <em>blow up(炸掉)</em> the house,” said Harry, but they weren’t listening.</p>
<p>“I suppose we could take him to the zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “. . . and leave him in the car. . . .”</p>
<p>“That cars new, he’s not sitting in it alone. . . .”</p>
<p>Dudley began to cry loudly. In fact, he wasn’t really crying — it had been years since he’d really cried — but he knew that if he <em>screwed up his face(哭丧着脸)</em> and <em>wailed(恸哭)</em>, his mother would give him anything he wanted.</p>
<p>“Dinky Duddydums, don’t cry, Mummy won’t let him <em>spoil(毁掉)</em> your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.</p>
<p>“I . . . don’t . . . want . . . him . . . t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, <em>pretend(假装的)</em> sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry a nasty grin through the gap in his mothers arms.</p>
<p>Just then, the doorbell rang — “Oh, good Lord, they’re here!” said Aunt Petunia <em>frantically(慌张的)</em> — and a moment later, Dudley’s best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked in with his mother. Piers was a scrawny boy with a face like a rat. He was usually the one who held people’s arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending to cry at once.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Piers Polkiss，达力的朋友，长着一张老鼠脸</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn’t believe his luck, was sitting in the back of the Dursleys’ car with Piers and Dudley, on the way to the zoo for the first time in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn’t been able to think of anything else to do with him, but before they’d left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.</p>
<p>“I’m warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close to Harry’s, “I’m warning you now, boy — any funny business, anything at all — and you’ll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to do anything,” said Harry, “honestly . . .”</p>
<p>But Uncle Vernon didn’t believe him. No one ever did.</p>
<p>The problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn’t make them happen.</p>
<p>Once, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the barbers looking as though he hadn’t been at all, had taken a pair of kitchen <em>scissors(剪刀)</em> and cut his hair so short he was almost <em>bald(秃顶的)</em> except for his <em>bangs(刘海)</em>, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly at Harry, who spent a sleepless night imagining school the next day, where he was already laughed at for his <em>baggy(松松垮垮的)</em> clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petunia had <em>sheared(修建)</em> it off. He had been given a week in his cupboard for this, even though he had tried to explain that he couldn’t explain how it had grown back so quickly.</p>
<p>Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying to force him into a <em>revolting(难看的)</em> old sweater of Dudley’s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it over his head, the smaller it seemed to become, until finally it might have fitted a hand <em>puppet(木偶)</em>, but certainly wouldn’t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have <em>shrunk(缩水)</em> in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn’t punished.</p>
<p>On the other hand, he’d gotten into terrible trouble for being found on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley’s gang had been chasing him as usual when, as much to Harry’s surprise as anyone else’s, there he was sitting on the <em>chimney(烟囱)</em>. The Dursleys had received a very angry letter from Harry’s <em>headmistress(女校长)</em> telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he’d tried to do (as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cupboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen doors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in mid-jump.</p>
<p>But today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth being with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that wasn’t school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg’s cabbage-smelling living room.</p>
<p>While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, Harry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.</p>
<p>“. . . roaring along like <em>maniacs(疯子)</em>, the young hoodlums,” he said, as a motorcycle overtook them.</p>
<p>“I had a dream about a motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front. He turned right around in his seat and yelled at Harry, his face like a gigantic beet with a mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON’T FLY!”</p>
<p>Dudley and Piers sniggered.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hoodlums /‘hudləm/ 流氓</p>
<p>gigantic /dʒaɪ’ɡæntɪk/ 巨大的</p>
<p>beet 甜菜</p>
<p>mustache 胡子</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I know they don’t,” said Harry. “It was only a dream.”</p>
<p>But he wished he hadn’t said anything. If there was one thing the Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking about anything acting in a way it shouldn’t, no matter if it was in a dream or even a cartoon — they seemed to think he might get dangerous ideas.</p>
<h2 id="2-At-the-zoo-with-Dudley-动物园之旅"><a href="#2-At-the-zoo-with-Dudley-动物园之旅" class="headerlink" title="2 At the zoo with Dudley 动物园之旅"></a>2 At the zoo with Dudley 动物园之旅</h2><p>It was a very sunny Saturday and the zoo was crowded with families. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn’t bad, either, Harry thought, licking it as they watched a gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn’t blond.</p>

<p>gorilla 大猩猩</p>
<p>scratching 挠</p>
<p>remarkably 非常地</p>
<p>blond adj. 金发的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry had the best morning he’d had in a long time. He was careful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by lunchtime, wouldn’t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting him. They ate in the zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had a tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn’t have enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed to finish the first.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tantrum /‘tæntrəm/ 发怒</p>
<p>knickerbocker glory /‘nɪkɚ,bɑkɚ ‘ɡlɔri/ 冰淇淋圣代</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good to last.</p>
<p>After lunch they went to the reptile house. It was cool and dark in there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all sorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found the largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon’s car and crushed it into a trash can — but at the moment it didn’t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Dudley stood with his nose pressed against the glass, staring at the glistening brown coils.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>glistening 发光的</p>
<p>coil /kɔɪl/ n. 卷；线圈</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Make it move,” he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped on the glass, but the snake didn’t budge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whined 发牢骚</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass smartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>knuckles 指关节</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>moaned 抱怨</p>
<p>shuffle /‘ʃʌfl/ <em>vi.</em> 拖着脚走</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the snake. He wouldn’t have been surprised if it had died of boredom itself — no company except stupid people drumming their fingers on the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than having a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit the rest of the house.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>intently 专心的</p>
<p>boredom 厌倦</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry’s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>beady /‘bidi/ 起泡的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It winked.</p>
<p>Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone was watching. They weren’t. He looked back at the snake and winked, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>winked 眨眼</p>
<p>stared 凝视</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes to the ceiling. It gave Harry a look that said quite plainly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jerk /dʒɝk/ vt. 猛拉</p>
<p>ceiling n. 天花板</p>
<p>plainly 直率的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I get that all the time.”</p>
<p>“I know,” Harry murmured through the glass, though he wasn’t sure the snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”</p>
<p>The snake nodded vigorously.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>vigorously /‘vɪgərəsli/ 活泼的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>The snake jabbed its tail at a little sign next to the glass. Harry peered at it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>jabbed 戳</p>
<p>tail 尾巴</p>
<p>peer vi. 凝视，盯着看；窥视</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Boa Constrictor, Brazil.</p>
<p>“Was it nice there?”</p>
<p>The boa constrictor jabbed its tail at the sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred in the zoo. “Oh, I see — so you’ve never been to Brazil?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>specimen 样本</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the snake shook its head, a deafening shout behind Harry made both of them jump. “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YOU WON’T BELIEVE WHAT IT’S DOING!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>deafening 震耳欲聋的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could.</p>
<p>“Out of the way, you,” he said, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened — one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close to the glass, the next, they had leapt back with howls of horror.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ribs 肋骨</p>
<p>concrete 混凝土</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor’s tank had vanished. The great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started running for the exits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gasped 喘息</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have <u>sworn</u> a low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come. . . . Thanksss, <u>amigo</u>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>swear: to promise or say firmly that you are telling the truth or that you will do something or behave in a particular way</p>
<p>amigo: a friend; used especially by or of a Spanish-speaking person</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The keeper of the reptile house was in shock.</p>
<p>“But the glass,” he kept saying, “where did the glass go?” The zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn’t done anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but by the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon’s car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for Harry at least, was Piers calming down enough to say, “Harry was talking to it, weren’t you, Harry?”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house before starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed to say, “Go — cupboard — stay — no meals,” before he <u>collapsed</u> into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a large <u>brandy</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>collapse: to fall down suddenly because of pressure or having no strength or support</p>
<p>brandy: a strong alcoholic drink made from wine and sometimes flavored with fruits</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry lay in his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had a watch. He didn’t know what time it was and he couldn’t be sure the Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn’t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food.</p>
<p>He’d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten <u>miserable</u> years, as long as he could remember, ever since he’d been a baby and his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn’t remember being in the car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burning pain on his forehead. This, he supposed, was the crash, though he couldn’t imagine where all the green light came from. He couldn’t remember his parents at all. His aunt and uncle never spoke about them, and of course he was forbidden to ask questions. There were no photographs of them in the house.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>miserable: very unhappy:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of some unknown <u>relation</u> coming to take him away, but it had never happened; the Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers in the street seemed to know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. A tiny man in a <u>violet</u> top hat had bowed to him once while out shopping with Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry <u>furiously</u> if he knew the man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out of the shop without buying anything. A wild-looking old woman dressed all in green had waved merrily at him once on a bus. A <u>bald</u> man in a very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand in the street the other day and then walked away without a word. The weirdest thing about all these people was the way they seemed to <u>vanish</u> the second Harry tried to get a closer look.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>relation: noun [C] (FAMILY MEMBER)  a member of your family.</p>
<p>violet: noun [C] (PLANT) a small plant with pleasant-smelling purple, blue, or white flowers</p>
<p>violin: noun [C] a wooden musical instrument with four strings that is held against the neck and played by moving a bow across the strings</p>
<p>furiously: adverb (ANGRY WAY)</p>
<p>bald: adjective (NO HAIR) with little or no hair on the head</p>
<p>vanish: to disappear or stop being present or existing, especially in a sudden, surprising way:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley’s <u>gang</u> hated that odd Harry Potter in his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked to disagree with Dudley’s gang.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gang: noun [ C, + sing/pl verb ] a group of young people, especially young men, who spend time together, often fighting with other groups and behaving badly:</p>

    <title>Harry Potter 1-3 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE</title>
    <url>/posts/41fbc48a.html</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-3-THE-LETTERS-FROM-NO-ONE"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-3-THE-LETTERS-FROM-NO-ONE" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-3 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE"></a>Harry Potter 1-3 THE LETTERS FROM NO ONE</h1><p>The escape of the Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest-ever punishment. By the time he was allowed out of his cupboard again, the summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out on his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she crossed Privet Drive on her <u>crutches</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>crutches拐杖</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley’s gang, who visited the house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but as Dudley was the biggest and stupidest of the lot, he was the leader. The rest of them were all quite happy to join in Dudley’s favorite sport: Harry Hunting.</p>
<p>This was why Harry spent as much time as possible out of the house, wandering around and thinking about the end of the holidays, where he could see a tiny ray of hope. When September came he would be going off to secondary school and, for the first time in his life, he wouldn’t be with Dudley. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle Vernon’s old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, on the other hand, was going to Stonewall High, the local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利进入了Stonewall公立高中，而达力进入了Smeltings私立高中。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“They stuff people’s heads down the toilet the first day at Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want to come upstairs and practice?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>toilet 厕所</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet’s never had anything as horrible as your head down it — it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he’d said.</p>
<p>One day in July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London to buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry at Mrs. Figg’s. Mrs. Figg wasn’t as bad as usual. It turned out she’d broken her leg tripping over one of her cats, and she didn’t seem quite as fond of them as before. She let Harry watch television and gave him a bit of chocolate cake that tasted as though she’d had it for several years.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fond: adjective (LIKING) having feelings of affection for someone or something, or having a liking for an activity:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Figg太太自从摔断腿以后就变得和善起来。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That evening, Dudley paraded around the living room for the family in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while the teachers weren’t looking. This was supposed to be good training for later life.</p>
<p>As he looked at Dudley in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was the proudest moment of his life. Aunt Petunia burst into tears and said she couldn’t believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown-up. Harry didn’t trust himself to speak. He thought two of his ribs might already have cracked from trying not to laugh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>handsome英俊的</p>
<p>ribs肋骨</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a horrible smell in the kitchen the next morning when Harry went in for breakfast. It seemed to be coming from a large metal tub in the sink. He went to have a look. The tub was full of what looked like dirty rags swimming in gray water.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>tub 金属盆</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“What’s this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened as they always did if he dared to ask a question.</p>
<p>“Your new school uniform,” she said.</p>
<p>Harry looked in the bowl again.</p>
<p>“Oh,” he said, “I didn’t realize it had to be so wet.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I’m dyeing some of Dudley’s old things gray for you. It’ll look just like everyone else’s when I’ve finished.”</p>
<p>Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not to argue. He sat down at the table and tried not to think about how he was going to look on his first day at Stonewall High — like he was wearing bits of old elephant skin, probably.</p>
<p>Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both with wrinkled noses because of the smell from Harry’s new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper as usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, on the table.</p>
<p>They heard the click of the mail slot and flop of letters on the doormat.</p>
<p>“Get the mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon from behind his paper.</p>
<p>“Make Harry get it.”</p>
<p>“Get the mail, Harry.”</p>
<p>“Make Dudley get it.”</p>
<p>“Poke him with your Smelting stick, Dudley.”</p>
<p>Harry dodged the Smelting stick and went to get the mail. Three things lay on the doormat: a postcard from Uncle Vernon’s sister Marge, who was vacationing on the Isle of Wight, a brown envelope that looked like a bill, and — a letter for Harry.</p>
<p>Harry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a giant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives — he didn’t belong to the library, so he’d never even got rude notes asking for books back. Yet here it was, a letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>twanging鼻音</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. H. Potter The Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey</p>
<p>The envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, and the address was written in emerald-green ink. There was no stamp.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>parchment羊皮纸</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利的信件特点是：黄色信封，绿色的墨水，没有贴邮票。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Turning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a purple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a snake surrounding a large letter H.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>狮子、鹰、獾、蛇代表了四大学院。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon from the kitchen. “What are you doing, checking for letter bombs?” He chuckled at his own joke.</p>
<p>Harry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon the bill and the postcard, sat down, and slowly began to open the yellow envelope.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snorted in disgust, and flipped over the postcard.</p>
<p>“Marge’s ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate a funny <u>whelk</u> . . .”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whelk: noun [ C ] a soft sea creature, similar to a snail, that lives in a hard shell</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry’s got something!” Harry was on the point of unfolding his letter, which was written on the same heavy <u>parchment</u> as the envelope, when it was jerked sharply out of his hand by Uncle Vernon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>parchment: noun the thin, dried skin of some animals that was used in the past for writing on, or a high-quality paper</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“That’s mine!” said Harry, trying to snatch it back.</p>
<p>“Who’d be writing to you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter open with one hand and glancing at it. His face went from red to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn’t stop there. Within seconds it was the grayish white of old porridge.</p>
<p>“P-P-Petunia!” he <u>gasped</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gasped: verb to take a short, quick breath through the mouth, especially because of surprise, pain, or shock:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out of his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read the first line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made a choking noise.</p>
<p>“Vernon! Oh my goodness — Vernon!”</p>
<p>They stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn’t used to being ignored. He gave his father a sharp tap on the head with his Smelting stick.</p>
<p>“I want to read that letter,” he said loudly.</p>
<p>“I want to read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it’s mine.”</p>
<p>“Get out, both of you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing the letter back inside its envelope.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>croak: verb If you croak, you speak with a rough voice because you have a sore or dry throat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry didn’t move.</p>
<p>“I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.</p>
<p>“Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.</p>
<p>“OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by the scruffs of their necks and threw them into the hall, slamming the kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had a furious but silent fight over who would listen at the keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling from one ear, lay flat on his stomach to listen at the crack between door and floor.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>slamming 砰地关上</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying in a quivering voice, “look at the address — how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don’t think they’re watching the house?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>quivering 颤抖的</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Watching — <u>spying</u> — might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>spy: noun [ C ] a person who secretly collects and reports information about the activities of another country or organization</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don’t want —”</p>
<p>Harry could see Uncle Vernon’s shiny black shoes pacing up and down the kitchen.</p>
<p>“No,” he said finally. “No, we’ll ignore it. If they don’t get an answer. . . . Yes, that’s best . . . we won’t do anything. . . .”</p>
<p>“But —”</p>
<p>“I’m not having one in the house, Petunia! Didn’t we swear when we took him in we’d <u>stamp out</u> that dangerous <u>nonsense</u>?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stamp sth out: to get rid of something that is wrong or harmful</p>
<p>nonsense: an idea, something said or written, or behavior that is silly or stupid:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That evening when he got back from work, Uncle Vernon did something he’d never done before; he visited Harry in his cupboard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>在收到给哈利的意外来信后，弗农夫妇都显得格外慌张，他们决定装作没有收到信。弗农在下班以后甚至专门到碗柜来看哈利。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Where’s my letter?” said Harry, the moment Uncle Vernon had <u>squeezed</u> through the door. “Who’s writing to me?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>squeeze: verb to press something firmly, especially from all sides in order to change its shape, reduce its size, or remove liquid from it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“No one. It was addressed to you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”</p>
<p>“It was not a mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard on it.”</p>
<p>“SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple of spiders fell from the ceiling. He took a few deep breaths and then forced his face into a smile, which looked quite painful.</p>
<p>“Er — yes, Harry — about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking . . . you’re really getting a bit big for it . . . we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley’s second bedroom.”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Don’t ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this <u>stuff</u> upstairs, now.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>stuff: noun a substance, especially when you do not know or say exactly what it is:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Dursleys’ house had four bedrooms: one for Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one for visitors (usually Uncle Vernon’s sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all the toys and things that wouldn’t fit into his first bedroom. It only took Harry one <u>trip</u> upstairs to move everything he owned from the cupboard to this room. He sat down on the bed and <u>stared</u> around him. Nearly everything in here was broken. The month-old video camera was lying on top of a small, working tank Dudley had once driven over the next door neighbor’s dog; in the corner was Dudley’s first-ever television set, which he’d put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was a large birdcage, which had once held a parrot that Dudley had swapped at school for a real air <u>rifle</u>, which was up on a shelf with the end all <u>bent</u> because Dudley had sat on it. Other shelves were full of books. They were the only things in the room that looked as though they’d never been touched.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>trip: noun a journey in which you go somewhere, usually for a short time, and come back again</p>
<p>stare: to look for a long time with the eyes wide open, especially when surprised, frightened, or thinking</p>
<p>rifle: noun [ C ] a type of gun with a long barrel (= part shaped like a tube), fired from the shoulder and designed to be accurate at long distances</p>
<p>bend: verb (CURVE) to (cause to) curve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>达力家有四个房间，一间是给弗农夫妇住的，一间是给来访者住的（通常是给弗农的姐姐玛姬住），一间给达力睡觉，另一间用来放达力房间放不下的玩具。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From downstairs came the sound of Dudley bawling at his mother, “I don’t want him in there . . . I need that room . . . make him get out. . . .”</p>
<p>Harry <u>sighed</u> and <u>stretched</u> out on the bed. Yesterday he’d have given anything to be up here. Today he’d rather be back in his cupboard with that letter than up here without it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sigh: verb [ I ] to breathe out slowly and noisily, expressing tiredness, sadness, pleasure, etc.</p>
<p>stretch: to make your body or your arms and legs straight so that they are as long as possible, in order to exercise the joints (= place where two bones are connected) after you have been in the same place or position for a long time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Next morning at breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was in shock. He’d screamed, whacked his father with his Smelting stick, been sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through the greenhouse roof, and he still didn’t have his room back. Harry was thinking about this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he’d opened the letter in the hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking at each other darkly.</p>
<p>When the mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be trying to be nice to Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things with his Smelting stick all the way down the hall. Then he shouted, “There’s another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, The Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive —’ ”</p>
<p>With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt from his seat and ran down the hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had to <u>wrestle</u> Dudley to the ground to get the letter from him, which was made difficult by the fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from behind. After a minute of confused fighting, in which everyone got hit a lot by the Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping for breath, with Harry’s letter clutched in his hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>wrestle: verb [ I or T ] to fight with someone (especially as a sport) by holding them and trying to throw them to the ground:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Go to your cupboard — I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed at Harry. “Dudley — go — just go.”</p>
<p>Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out of his cupboard and they seemed to know he hadn’t received his first letter. Surely that meant they’d try again? And this time he’d make sure they didn’t fail. He had a plan.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利从碗柜搬到了那个最小的房间，信封上的地址也从碗柜改到了那个小房间。非常神奇。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The repaired alarm clock rang at six o’clock the next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently He mustn’t wake the Dursleys. He <u>stole</u> downstairs without turning on any of the lights.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>steal: verb [ I or T ] to take something without the permission or knowledge of the owner and keep it:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He was going to wait for the postman on the corner of Privet Drive and get the letters for number four first. His heart hammered as he crept across the dark hall toward the front door —</p>
<p>“AAAAARRRGH!”</p>
<p>Harry leapt into the air; he’d trodden on something big and squashy on the doormat — something alive!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>squashy: adjective soft and easy to crush:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lights clicked on upstairs and to his horror Harry realized that the big, squashy something had been his uncle’s face. Uncle Vernon had been lying at the foot of the front door in a sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn’t do exactly what he’d been trying to do. He shouted at Harry for about half an hour and then told him to go and make a cup of tea. Harry shuffled miserably off into the kitchen and by the time he got back, the mail had arrived, right into Uncle Vernon’s lap. Harry could see three letters addressed in green ink.</p>
<p>“I want —” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon didn’t go to work that day. He stayed at home and <u>nailed</u> up the mail slot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>nail: noun [ C ] a small, thin piece of metal with one pointed end and one flat end that you hit into something with a hammer, especially in order to fasten or join it to something else:</p>
<p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/nail_noun_002_24408.jpg" alt="nail"></p>
<p>slot: noun [C] (LONG HOLE) a long, narrow hole, especially one for putting coins into or for fitting a separate piece into:</p>
<p><img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/slot_noun_002_34292.jpg?version=5.0.165" alt="slot"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>“See,” he explained to Aunt Petunia through a mouthful of nails, “if they can’t deliver them they’ll just give up.”</p>
<p>“I’m not sure that’ll work, Vernon.”</p>
<p>“Oh, these peoples minds work in strange ways, Petunia, they’re not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to knock in a nail with the piece of fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.</p>
<p>On Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived for Harry. As they couldn’t go through the mail slot they had been pushed under the door, slotted through the sides, and a few even forced through the small window in the downstairs bathroom.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon stayed at home again. After burning all the letters, he got out a hammer and nails and boarded up the cracks around the front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” as he worked, and jumped at small noises.</p>
<p>On Saturday, things began to get out of hand. Twenty-four letters to Harry found their way into the house, rolled up and hidden inside each of the two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through the living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls to the post office and the dairy trying to find someone to complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded the letters in her food processor.</p>
<p>“Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry in amazement.</p>
<p>On Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down at the breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.</p>
<p>“No post on Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully as he spread <u>marmalade</u> on his newspapers, “no damn letters today —”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>marmalade: noun [ U ] a soft substance with a sweet but slightly bitter taste, made by cooking fruit such as oranges with sugar to preserve it. It is eaten on bread, usually for breakfast.</p>
<p> <img src="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/images/thumb/marmal_noun_002_22469.jpg?version=5.0.165" alt="picture of marmalade"></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Something came whizzing down the kitchen chimney as he spoke and caught him sharply on the back of the head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out of the fireplace like bullets. The Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt into the air trying to catch one —</p>
<p>“Out! OUT!”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon seized Harry around the waist and threw him into the hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out with their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed the door shut. They could hear the letters still streaming into the room, bouncing off the walls and floor.</p>
<p>“That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying to speak calmly but pulling great tufts out of his mustache at the same time. “I want you all back here in five minutes ready to leave. We’re going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”</p>
<p>He looked so dangerous with half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through the boarded-up doors and were in the car, speeding toward the highway. Dudley was sniffling in the back seat; his father had hit him round the head for holding them up while he tried to pack his television, VCR, and computer in his sports bag.</p>
<p>They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn’t dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take a sharp turn and drive in the opposite direction for a while.</p>
<p>“Shake ’em off . . . shake ’em off,” he would <u>mutter</u> whenever he did this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>mutter: verb [ I or T ] to speak quietly and in a low voice that is not easy to hear, often when you are worried or complaining about something:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They didn’t stop to eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He’d never had such a bad day in his life. He was hungry, he’d missed five television programs he’d wanted to see, and he’d never gone so long without blowing up an alien on his computer.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon stopped at last outside a gloomy-looking hotel on the outskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry shared a room with twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting on the windowsill, staring down at the lights of passing cars and wondering. . . .</p>
<p>They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on toast for breakfast the next day. They had just finished when the owner of the hotel came over to their table.</p>
<p>“ ’Scuse me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got about an ’undred of these at the front desk.”</p>
<p>She held up a letter so they could read the green ink address:</p>
<p>Mr. H. Potter Room 17 Railview Hotel Cokeworth</p>
<p>Harry made a grab for the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out of the way. The woman stared.</p>
<p>“I’ll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her from the dining room.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better just to go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn’t seem to hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none of them knew. He drove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field, halfway across a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking garage.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>弗农一家因为忍受不了无休止的邮件被迫逃离房子。弗农带着一家人漫无目的的在高速路上奔驰，最后在一家郊区的破旅馆落脚。然而第二天就有近一百封邮件送到旅馆前台。于是，弗农干脆开车带着全家进了森林。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Daddy’s gone mad, hasn’t he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked at the coast, locked them all inside the car, and disappeared.</p>
<p>It started to rain. Great drops beat on the roof of the car. Dudley sniveled.</p>
<p>“It’s Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto’s on tonight. I want to stay somewhere with a television.”</p>
<p>Monday. This reminded Harry of something. If it was Monday — and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of the week, because of television — then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry’s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never exactly fun — last year, the Dursleys had given him a coat hanger and a pair of Uncle Vernon’s old socks. Still, you weren’t eleven every day.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying a long, thin package and didn’t answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he’d bought.</p>
<p>“Found the perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”</p>
<p>It was very cold outside the car. Uncle Vernon was pointing at what looked like a large rock way out at sea. Perched on top of the rock was the most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television in there.</p>
<p>“Storm forecast for tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman’s kindly agreed to lend us his boat!”</p>
<p>A toothless old man came <u>ambling</u> up to them, pointing, with a rather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray water below them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>amble: verb [ I usually + adv/prep ] to walk in a slow and relaxed way:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“I’ve already got us some <u>rations</u>,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>rations: plural noun the food given to someone at one time, esp. to soldiers</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was freezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led the way to the broken-down house.</p>
<p>The inside was horrible; it smelled strongly of seaweed, the wind whistled through the gaps in the wooden walls, and the fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon’s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and four bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.</p>
<p>“Could do with some of those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.</p>
<p>He was in a very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though the thought didn’t cheer him up at all.</p>
<p>As night fell, the promised storm blew up around them. <u>Spray</u> from the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled the <u>filthy</u> windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the moth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>spray: noun [U] a mass of very small drops of liquid carried in the air:</p>
<p>filthy: adjective (DIRTY) extremely or unpleasantly dirty:</p>

<p>The storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on. Harry couldn’t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get comfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley’s snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight. The lighted dial of Dudley’s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist, told Harry he’d be eleven in ten minutes’ time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if the Dursleys would remember at all, wondering where the letter writer was now.</p>
<p>Five minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped the roof wasn’t going to fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet Drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he’d be able to steal one somehow.</p>
<p>Three minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea?</p>
<p>One minute to go and he’d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . twenty . . . ten . . . nine — maybe he’d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him — three . . . two . . . one . . .</p>
<p>BOOM.</p>
<p>The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at the door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="前言"><a href="#前言" class="headerlink" title="前言"></a>前言</h1><p>博主在CSDN上写博客多年，然而眼看着CSDN的广告和付费功能越加越多，越发不喜欢这种氛围，而且博主的很多内容被无良的广告站主爬为己用，成了他们赚钱的工具，更觉得气愤。索性自己在<code>Github Page</code>的基础上，配置<code>coding</code>和<code>vercel</code>平台，使用<code>dnspod</code>的分区域解析功能，搭建了自己的个人博客。在这里记录一下自己的配置细节，希望能帮助到有同样想法的朋友。</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="发布"><a href="#发布" class="headerlink" title="发布"></a>发布</h2><ul>
<li><strong>分线路解析需要注意域名设置的先后问题</strong><br>由于域名解析存在缓存，因此在配置DNS国内外分流解析时，建议先配置coding的域名，然后再配置Github的域名。然后再将Github的<code>线路类型</code>改为<code>境外</code>，coding的<code>线路类型</code>改为<code>境内</code>，即可实现分线路解析。</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="1-Github"><a href="#1-Github" class="headerlink" title="1. Github"></a>1. Github</h3><p>我将博客的源码上传至gihub的私有仓库中，然后使用<code>Github Action</code>将生成的网页发布到<a href="https://github.com/echosun1996/echosun1996.github.io">Github个人页仓库</a>中，然后就可以通过<a href="echosun1996.github.io">Github Page</a>进行浏览，然而国内由于各种原因，导致该页面经常无法访问，因此需要将博客发布到不同的平台上，并通过<code>DNSPod</code>进行分流，实现国内、外的正常访问。</p>
<p>由于我已经将导出后的静态页面部署至<a href="echosun1996.github.io">Github Page</a>，因此，在其他的平台上只需要对github上的这一仓库进行克隆，并执行静态展示即可，不需要额外配置hexo编译脚本。</p>
<ul>
<li>修改github个人页域名</li>
</ul>
<p>最终目的：用<code>blog.echosun.top</code>访问个人主页</p>
<ol>
<li>首先在<code>cloudflare</code>中为<code>blog.echosun.top</code>添加<code>CNAME</code>记录到<code>echosun1996.github.io</code>。</li>
<li>再在<a href="https://github.com/echosun1996/echosun1996.github.io">Github个人页仓库</a>的<code>settings</code>中将域名修改为<code>blog.echosun.top</code>，同时，确保选中<code>Enforce HTTPS</code>。</li>
<li>在博客目录下的<code>public</code>文件夹中创建<code>CNAME</code>文件，内容为<code>blog.echosun.top</code>，即避免每次上传仓库后需要再次手动修改github个人页域名设置的问题。</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-coding"><a href="#2-coding" class="headerlink" title="2. coding"></a>2. coding</h3><p><a href="https://coding.net/">coding</a>是腾讯提供的一个代码管理工具，类似于github，也可以发布自己的个人页，配合<code>DNSPod</code>的区域分流解析功能，实现国内外分线路解析，避免国内用户不能访问<code>Github Page</code>的问题。</p>
<p>创建一个<code>DevOps项目</code>，然后在<code>代码仓库</code>中克隆github上的仓库，然后在”持续部署/静态网站/新建静态网站”中添加一个<code>静态网站</code>。</p>
<p>添加完成后在<code>自定义域名</code>中将域名改为<code>blog.echosun.top</code>。</p>
<p><strong>注意，在配置<code>Github Action</code>时，由于coding更改了域名，因此需要将<code>e.coding.net</code>加入<code>known_hosts</code>，很多旧教程使用<code>coding.net</code>会导致报<code>Host key verification failed.fatal: Could not read from remote repository.</code>的错误。正确的<code>Github Action</code>脚本文件如下：</strong></p>

Furthermore, with continuing advances in individual genome (基因组) sequencing and the advent of personalized <u>medicine</u>, more ==non-scientists== will need to be comfortable <u>analyzing complex scientific information</u> to make decisions that directly affect their ==quality of life==.</p>

<p>定位段落: </p>
<p>Unfortunately, pieces of ==science journalism== can also <u>oversimplify and generalize their subject material to the point</u> that the basic information conveyed is <u>obscured</u> or at worst, <u>obviously wrong</u>. The impact of a basic discovery on human health can be exaggerated so that the public thinks a miraculous cure is a few months to years away when in reality the significance of the study is far more limited.</p>

<li><p>What should <u>==scientists==</u> do to <u>impart their latest findings to the public</u> more <u>effectively</u>?<br>A) Give training to science journalists.<br>B) Stimulate public interest in science.<br>C) Seek timely assistance from the media.<br>D) Improve their ==communication== skills.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>难度: 易。</p>
<p>定位段落: </p>
<p>Even though <u>scientists</u> play a part in transmitting information to journalists and ultimately the ==public==, too often the blame for ineffective communication is placed on the side of the journalists. We believe, that at least part of the problem lies in places other than the interaction between scientists and members of the media, and exists because for one thing we <u>underestimate how difficult it is for scientists to ==communicate== ==effectively== with a diversity of audiences</u>, and for another most scientists do not receive formal training in <u>science ==communication==</u>.</p>

<p>Effective Friday, Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists ( <code>SAG-AFTRA</code>) has declared a <code>strike against</code> 11 <code>video game publishers</code> over games that went into production after Feb.17, 2015. The companies include some of the heavyweights of the industry, like Electronic Arts Productions, Insomniac Games, Activision and Disney.</p>
<p><u>The <code>strike</code> comes in light of an unsuccessful 19 months of negotiations after the existing labor contract known as the Interactive Media Agreement expired in late 2014.</u> Overall, the strike is an effort to provide more secondary compensation along with other concerns, such as transparency upon hiring talent and on-set (制作中) safety precautions.</p>

<p>定位段落: </p>
<p><u>The <code>video gaming industry</code> has ballooned in recent years</u>. The Los Angeles Times reports that the industry is in the midst of an <u>intense increase in cash flow</u>. In 2015, gaming produced $ 23.5 billion in domestic revenue.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>难度: 难。</p>
<p>定位段落: </p>
<p><u>But</u> SAG-AFTRA says <u> <code>voice actors</code> don’t receive residuals (追加酬金) for their gaming work</u>. Instead, they receive a fixed rate, which is typically about $ 825 for a standard four-hour vocal session. So the <u><code>voice actors</code> are pushing for the idea of secondary compensation</u>—a performance bonus every time a game sells 2 million copies or downloads, or reaches 2 million subscribers, with a cap at 8 million.</p>

<p>There was a pause. Then SMASH!</p>
<p>The door was hit with such force that it <u>swung</u> clean off its <u>hinges</u> and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor.</p>

<p>A giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black <u>beetles</u> under all the hair.</p>

<p>The giant <u>squeezed</u> his way into the <u>hut</u>, stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, and fitted it easily back into its frame. The noise of the storm outside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Couldn’t make us a cup o’ tea, could yeh? It’s not been an easy journey. . . .”</p>

<p>Dudley <u>squeaked</u> and ran to hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>squeak /skwiːk/: <em>verb (SOUND)</em> to make a short, very high cry or sound:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“An’ here’s Harry!” said the giant.</p>
<p>Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile.</p>
<p>“Las’ time I saw you, you was only a baby,” said the giant. “Yeh look a lot like <u>yer</u> dad, but yeh’ve got yer mom’s eyes.”</p>

<p>Uncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise.</p>
<p>“I demand that you leave at once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!”</p>
<p>“Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great <u>prune</u>,” said the giant; he reached over the back of the sofa, jerked the gun out of Uncle Vernon’s hands, bent it into a <u>knot</u> as easily as if it had been made of rubber, and threw it into a corner of the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>prune /pruːn/: <em>verb (CUT)</em> to cut off branches from a tree, bush, or plant, especially so that it will grow better in the future:</p>

<p>Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being trodden on.</p>
<p>“Anyway — Harry,” said the giant, turning his back on the Dursleys, “a very happy birthday to yeh. Got <u>summat</u> fer <u>yeh</u> here — I mighta sat on it at some point, but it’ll taste all right.”</p>
<blockquote>

<p>From an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly <u>squashed</u> box. Harry opened it with trembling fingers. Inside was a large, <u>sticky</u> chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on it in green icing.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>sticky /ˈstɪk.i/: <em>adjective (NOT DRY/SMOOTH)</em> made of or covered with a substance that stays attached to any surface it touches:</p>

<p>Harry looked up at the giant. He meant to say thank you, but the words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”</p>
<p>The giant chuckled.</p>
<p>“True, I haven’t introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and Grounds at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry’s whole arm.</p>
<p>“What about that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I’d not say no ter summat stronger if yeh’ve got it, mind.”</p>

<p>His eyes fell on the empty <u>grate</u> with the <u>shriveled</u> chip bags in it and he <u>snorted</u>. He bent down over the fireplace; they couldn’t see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a <u>roaring</u> fire there. It filled the whole <u>damp</u> hut with flickering light and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he’d sunk into a hot bath.</p>

<p>The giant sat back down on the sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat: a copper <u>kettle</u>, a <u>squashy</u> package of <u>sausages</u>, a <u>poker</u>, a teapot, several chipped <u>mugs</u>, and a bottle of some <u>amber</u> liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea. Soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a thing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley <u>fidgeted</u> a little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don’t touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”</p>
<p>The giant chuckled darkly.</p>

<p>He passed the sausages to Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn’t take his eyes off the giant. Finally, as nobody seemed about to explain anything, he said, “I’m sorry, but I still don’t really know who you are.”</p>
<p>The giant took a <u>gulp</u> of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>“Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An’ like I told yeh, I’m Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts — yeh’ll know all about Hogwarts, o’ course.”</p>
<p>“Er — no,” said Harry.</p>
<p>Hagrid looked shocked.</p>
<p>“Sorry,” Harry said quickly.</p>
<p>“Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning to stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back into the shadows. “It’s them as should be sorry! I knew yeh weren’t gettin’ yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn’t even know abou’ Hogwarts, fer cryin’ out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yer parents learned it all?”</p>
<p>“All what?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus’ one second!”</p>
<p>He had leapt to his feet. In his anger he seemed to fill the whole hut. The Dursleys were cowering against the wall.</p>
<p>“Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled at the Dursleys, “that this boy — this boy! — knows nothin’ abou’ — about ANYTHING?”</p>
<p>Harry thought this was going a bit far. He had been to school, after all, and his marks weren’t bad.</p>

<p>“But yeh must know about yer mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they’re famous. You’re famous.”</p>

<p>Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.</p>
<p>“Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sir! I forbid you to tell the boy anything!”</p>

<p>“You never told him? Never told him what was in the letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An’ you’ve kept it from him all these years?” “Kept what from me?” said Harry eagerly.</p>
<p>“STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon in panic.</p>
<p>Aunt Petunia gave a <u>gasp</u> of <u>horror</u>.</p>
<p>“Ah, go boil yer heads, both of yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry — yer a wizard.”</p>

<p>“I’m a what?” gasped Harry.</p>
<p>“A wizard, o’ course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down on the sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an’ a thumpin’ good’un, I’d say, once yeh’ve been trained up a bit. With a mum an’ dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An’ I reckon it’s abou’ time yeh read yer letter.”</p>
<p>Harry <u>stretched</u> out his hand at last to take the yellowish envelope, addressed in <u>emerald</u> green to Mr. H. Potter, The Floor, Huton-the-Rock, The Sea. He pulled out the letter and read:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Questions exploded inside Harry’s head like fireworks and he couldn’t decide which to ask first. After a few minutes he <u>stammered</u>, “What does it mean, they await my owl?” “Gallopin’ Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping a hand to his forehead with enough force to knock over a <u>cart</u> horse, and from yet another pocket inside his <u>overcoat</u> he pulled an owl — a real, live, rather ruffled-looking owl — a long <u>quill</u>, and a roll of <u>parchment</u>. With his tongue between his teeth he scribbled a note that Harry could read upside down:</p>

<p>Hagrid rolled up the note, gave it to the owl, which <u>clamped</u> it in its beak, went to the door, and threw the owl out into the storm. Then he came back and sat down as though this was as normal as talking on the telephone.</p>
<p>Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly. “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen-faced but looking very angry, moved into the firelight.</p>
<p>“He’s not going,” he said.</p>
<p>Hagrid <u>grunted</u>.</p>

<p>“I’d like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.</p>
<p>“A what?” said Harry, interested.</p>
<p>“A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it’s what we call nonmagic folk like them. An’ it’s your bad luck you grew up in a family o’ the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”</p>
<p>“We swore when we took him in we’d put a stop to that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we’d stamp it out of him! Wizard indeed!”</p>
<p>“You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I’m a — a wizard?”</p>
<p>“Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! Of course we knew! How could you not be, my <u>dratted</u> sister being what she was? Oh, she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that — that school — and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog <u>spawn</u>, turning teacups into <u>rats</u>.

<p>She stopped to draw a deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting to say all this for years.</p>
<p>“Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you, and of course I knew you’d be just the same, just as strange, just as — as — abnormal — and then, if you please, she went and got herself <u>blown up</u> and we got landed with you!”</p>

<p>Harry had gone very white. As soon as he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died in a car crash!”</p>
<p>“CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that the Dursleys scuttled back to their corner. “How could a car crash kill Lily an’ James Potter? It’s an outrage! A scandal! Harry Potter not knowin’ his own story when every kid in our world knows his name!”</p>
<p>“But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.</p>
<p>The anger faded from Hagrid’s face. He looked suddenly anxious. “I never expected this,” he said, in a low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin’ hold of yeh, how much yeh didn’t know. Ah, Harry, I don’ know if I’m the right person ter tell yeh — but someone’s gotta — yeh can’t go off ter Hogwarts not knowin’.”</p>
<p>He threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh — mind, I can’t tell yeh everythin’, it’s a great myst’ry, parts of it. . . .”</p>
<p>He sat down, stared into the fire for a few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with — with a person called — but it’s incredible yeh don’t know his name, everyone in our world knows —”</p>
<p>“Who?”</p>
<p>“Well — I don’ like sayin’ the name if I can help it. No one does.”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Gulpin’ gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went . . . bad. As bad as you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was . . .”</p>

<p>“Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.</p>
<p>“Nah — can’t spell it. All right — Voldemort.” Hagrid <u>shuddered</u>. “Don’ make me say it again. Anyway, this — this wizard, about twenty years ago now, started lookin’ fer followers. Got ’em, too — some were afraid, some just wanted a bit o’ his power, ’cause he was gettin’ himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn’t know who ter trust, didn’t dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches . . . terrible things happened. He was takin’ over. ’Course, some stood up to him — an’ he killed ’em. Horribly.

<p>“Sorry,” he said. “But it’s that sad — knew yer mum an’ dad, an’ nicer people yeh couldn’t find — anyway . . .</p>
<p>“You-Know-Who killed ’em. An’ then — an’ this is the real myst’ry of the thing — he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter make a clean job of it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin’ by then.

<p>Something very painful was going on in Harry’s mind. As Hagrid’s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before — and he remembered something else, for the first time in his life: a high, cold, cruel laugh.</p>
<p>Hagrid was watching him sadly.</p>
<p>“Took yeh from the ruined house myself, on Dumbledore’s orders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .”</p>
<p>“Load of old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Hagrid and his fists were clenched.</p>
<p>“Now, you listen here, boy,” he <u>snarled</u>, “I accept there’s something strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn’t have cured — and as for all this about your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and the world’s better off without them in my opinion — asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these wizarding types — just what I expected, always knew they’d come to a sticky end —”</p>

</ul>

<p>But at that moment, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and drew a battered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, “I’m warning you, Dursley — I’m warning you — one more word . . .”</p>
<p>In danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a <u>bearded</u> <u>giant</u>, Uncle Vernon’s courage failed again; he flattened himself against the wall and fell silent.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>beard /bɪrd/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> the hair that some men allow to grow on the lower part of their face:<br>a flowing white beard<br>He’s growing a beard.<br>He shaved off his beard but kept his mustache.</li>

<p>“That’s better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor.</p>
<p>Harry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them.</p>
<p>“But what happened to Vol-, sorry — I mean, You-Know-Who?”</p>
<p>“Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That’s the biggest myst’ry, see . . . he was gettin’ more an’ more powerful — why’d he go?</p>
<p>“Some say he died. <u>Codswallop</u>, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die. Some say he’s still out there, bidin’ his time, like, but I don’ believe it. People who was on his side came back ter ours. Some of ’em came outta kinda trances. Don’ reckon they could’ve done if he was comin’ back.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>codswallop /ˈkɑːdzˌwɑː.ləp/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> nonsense:<br>What a load of codswallop!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Most of us reckon he’s still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak to carry on. ’Cause somethin’ about you finished him, Harry. There was somethin’ goin’ on that night he hadn’t counted on — I dunno what it was, no one does — but somethin’ about you stumped him, all right.”</p>
<p>Hagrid looked at Harry with warmth and respect blazing in his eyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He’d spent his life being <u>clouted</u> by Dudley, and <u>bullied</u> by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wizard, why hadn’t they been turned into warty toads every time they’d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he’d once defeated the greatest <u>sorcerer</u> in the world, how come Dudley had always been able to kick him around like a football?</p>

<p>“Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made a mistake. I don’t think I can be a wizard.”</p>
<p>To his surprise, Hagrid <u>chuckled</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>chuckle /ˈtʃʌk.əl/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to laugh quietly:<br>She was chuckling as she read the letter.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Not a wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?”</p>
<p>Harry looked into the fire. Now he came to think about it . . . every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle <u>furious</u> with him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry . . . chased by Dudley’s gang, he had somehow found himself out of their reach . . . dreading going to school with that ridiculous haircut, he’d managed to make it grow back . . . and the very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn’t he got his <u>revenge</u>, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn’t he set a boa constrictor on him?</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not a wizard — you wait, you’ll be right famous at Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>But Uncle Vernon wasn’t going to give in without a fight.</p>
<p>“Haven’t I told you he’s not going? ” he <u>hissed</u>. “He’s going to Stonewall High and he’ll be grateful for it. I’ve read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish — spell books and wands and —”</p>

<p>“If he wants ter go, a great Muggle like you won’t stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an’ James Potter’s son goin’ ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name’s been down ever since he was born. He’s off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world. Seven years there and he won’t know himself. He’ll be with youngsters of his own sort, fer a change, an’ he’ll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had, Albus Dumbled—”</p>
<p>“I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TO TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.</p>
<p>But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER —” he thundered, “— INSULT — ALBUS — DUMBLEDORE — IN — FRONT OF — ME!”</p>
<p>He brought the umbrella swishing down through the air to point at Dudley — there was a flash of violet light, a sound like a firecracker, a sharp squeal, and the next second, Dudley was dancing on the spot with his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling in pain. When he turned his back on them, Harry saw a curly pig’s tail poking through a hole in his <u>trousers</u>.</p>

<p>Hagrid looked down at his umbrella and stroked his beard.</p>
<p>“Shouldn’ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn’t work anyway. Meant ter turn him into a pig, but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there wasn’t much left ter do.”</p>
<p>He cast a sideways look at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.</p>
<p>“Be grateful if yeh didn’t mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts,” he said. “I’m — er — not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin’. I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an’ get yer letters to yeh an’ stuff — one o’ the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job —”</p>
<p>“Why aren’t you supposed to do magic?” asked Harry.</p>
<p>“Oh, well — I was at Hogwarts meself but I — er — got expelled, ter tell yeh the truth. In me third year. They snapped me wand in half an’ everything. But Dumbledore let me stay on as <u>gamekeeper</u>. Great man, Dumbledore.”</p>

Harry could hear the <u>drone</u> of hundreds of voices from a doorway to the right — the rest of the school must already be here — but Professor McGonagall showed the first years into a small, empty <u>chamber</u> off the hall.

<p>“How exactly do they sort us into Houses?” he asked Ron.</p>
<p>“Some sort of test, I think. Fred said it hurts a lot, but I think he was joking.”</p>
<p>Harry’s heart gave a horrible <u>jolt</u>. A test? In front of the whole school? But he didn’t know any magic yet — what on earth would he have to do? He hadn’t expected something like this the moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast about all the spells she’d learned and wondering which one she’d need. Harry tried hard not to listen to her. He’d never been more nervous, never, not even when he’d had to take a school report home to the Dursleys saying that he’d somehow turned his teachers <u>wig</u> blue. He kept his eyes fixed on the door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him to his <u>doom</u>.</p>

<p>It was hard to believe there was a ceiling there at all, and that the Great Hall didn’t simply open on to the <u>heavens</u>.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry quickly looked down again as Professor McGonagall silently placed a four-legged <u>stool</u> in front of the first years. On top of the stool she put a pointed wizard’s hat. This hat was <u>patched</u> and <u>frayed</u> and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn’t have let it in the house.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>stool /stuːl/ :  <em>noun</em><br>a seat that has three or four legs, but no back or arms<br>a bar stool</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Maybe they had to try and get a rabbit out of it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed the sort of thing — noticing that everyone in the hall was now staring at the hat, he stared at it, too. For a few seconds, there was complete silence. Then the hat <u>twitched</u>. A <u>rip</u> near the <u>brim</u> opened wide like a mouth — and the hat began to sing:</p>
<p>“Oh, you may not think I’m pretty, But don’t judge on what you see, I’ll eat myself if you can find A smarter hat than me.</p>
<p>You can keep your <u>bowlers</u> black, Your top hats <u>sleek</u> and tall, For I’m the Hogwarts Sorting Hat And I can <u>cap</u> them all.</p>
<p>There’s nothing hidden in your head The Sorting Hat can’t see, So try me on and I will tell you Where you ought to be.</p>
<p>You might belong in Gryffindor, Where <u>dwell</u> the brave at heart, Their <u>daring</u>, nerve, and <u>chivalry</u> Set Gryffindors apart; You might belong in Hufflepuff, Where they are just and <u>loyal</u>, Those patient Hufflepuffs are true And unafraid of <u>toil</u>; Or yet in wise old Ravenclaw, If you’ve a ready mind, Where those of <u>wit</u> and learning, Will always find their kind; Or perhaps in Slytherin You’ll make your real friends, Those <u>cunning</u> <u>folk</u> use any means To achieve their ends.</p>
<p>So put me on! Don’t be afraid!</p>
<p>And don’t get in a <u>flap</u>!</p>
<p>You’re in safe hands (though I have none) For I’m a Thinking Cap!”</p>
<p>The whole hall <u>burst</u> into <u>applause</u> as the hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again.</p>
<p>“So we’ve just got to try on the hat!” Ron whispered to Harry. “I’ll kill Fred, he was going on about <u>wrestling</u> a <u>troll</u>.”</p>
<p>Harry smiled <u>weakly</u>. Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better than having to do a spell, but he did wish they could have tried it on without everyone watching. The hat seemed to be asking rather a lot; Harry didn’t feel brave or quick-<u>witted</u> or any of it at the moment. If only the hat had mentioned a House for people who felt a bit <u>queasy</u>, that would have been the one for him.</p>
<p>Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding a long roll of parchment.</p>
<h2 id="3-Put-on-the-sorting-hat-戴上分院帽"><a href="#3-Put-on-the-sorting-hat-戴上分院帽" class="headerlink" title="3 Put on the sorting hat 戴上分院帽"></a>3 Put on the sorting hat 戴上分院帽</h2><p>“When I call your name, you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”</p>
<p>A pink-faced girl with <u>blonde</u> <u>pigtails</u> stumbled out of line, put on the hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. A moment’s pause —</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abbott, Hannah 汉娜 艾博 是一个面色红润的女孩，</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat.</p>
<p>The table on the right cheered and clapped as Hannah went to sit down at the Hufflepuff table. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar waving merrily at her.</p>
<p>“Bones, Susan!”</p>
<p>“HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted the hat again, and Susan scuttled off to sit next to Hannah.</p>
<p>“Boot, Terry!”</p>
<p>“RAVENCLAW!”</p>
<p>The table second from the left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up to shake hands with Terry as he joined them.</p>
<p>“Brocklehurst, Mandy” went to Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became the first new Gryffindor, and the table on the far left exploded with cheers; Harry could see Ron’s twin brothers catcalling.</p>
<p>“Bulstrode, Millicent” then became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry’s imagination, after all he’d heard about Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot.</p>
<p>He was starting to feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked for teams during gym at his old school. He had always been last to be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley to think they liked him.</p>
<p>“Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”</p>
<p>“HUFFLEPUFF!”</p>
<p>Sometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shouted out the House at once, but at others it took a little while to decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” the sandy-haired boy next to Harry in the line, sat on the stool for almost a whole minute before the hat declared him a Gryffindor.</p>
<p>“Granger, Hermione!”</p>
<p>Hermione almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.</p>
<p>“GRYFFINDOR!” shouted the hat. Ron groaned.</p>
<p>A horrible thought struck Harry, as horrible thoughts always do when you’re very nervous. What if he wasn’t chosen at all? What if he just sat there with the hat over his eyes for ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been a mistake and he’d better get back on the train?</p>
<p>When Neville Longbottom, the boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over on his way to the stool. The hat took a long time to decide with Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had to jog back amid gales of laughter to give it to “MacDougal, Morag.”</p>
<p>Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”</p>
<p>Malfoy went to join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased with himself.</p>
<p>There weren’t many people left now.</p>
<p>“Moon” . . . , “Nott” . . . , “Parkinson” . . . , then a pair of twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil” . . . , then “Perks, Sally-Anne” . . . , and then, at last —</p>
<p>“Potter, Harry!”</p>
<h2 id="4-Harry’s-turn-轮到哈利了"><a href="#4-Harry’s-turn-轮到哈利了" class="headerlink" title="4 Harry’s turn 轮到哈利了"></a>4 Harry’s turn 轮到哈利了</h2><p>As Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly <u>broke out</u> like little <u>hissing</u> fires all over the hall.</p>
<p>“Potter, did she say?”</p>
<p>“The Harry Potter?”</p>
<p>The last thing Harry saw before the hat dropped over his eyes was the hall full of people <u>craning</u> to get a good look at him. Next second he was looking at the black inside of the hat. He waited.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” said a small voice in his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There’s talent, oh my goodness, yes — and a nice <u>thirst</u> to prove yourself, now that’s interesting. . . . So where shall I put you?”</p>
<p>Harry gripped the edges of the stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.</p>
<p>“Not Slytherin, eh?” said the small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin will help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that — no? Well, if you’re sure — better be GRYFFINDOR!”</p>
<p>Harry heard the hat shout the last word to the whole hall. He took off the hat and walked shakily toward the Gryffindor table. He was so relieved to have been chosen and not put in Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting the loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while the Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite the ghost in the ruff he’d seen earlier. The ghost patted his arm, giving Harry the sudden, horrible feeling he’d just plunged it into a bucket of ice-cold water.</p>
<p>He could see the High Table properly now. At the end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, in the center of the High Table, in a large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him at once from the card he’d gotten out of the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbledore’s silver hair was the only thing in the whole hall that shone as brightly as the ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirrell, too, the nervous young man from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar in a large purple turban.</p>
<p>And now there were only four people left to be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” a Black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry at the Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became a Ravenclaw and then it was Ron’s turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under the table and a second later the hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”</p>
<p>Harry clapped loudly with the rest as Ron collapsed into the chair next to him.</p>
<p>“Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley pompously across Harry as “Zabini, Blaise,” was made a Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took the Sorting Hat away.</p>
<p>Harry looked down at his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. The pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.</p>
<p>Albus Dumbledore had gotten to his feet. He was beaming at the students, his arms opened wide, as if nothing could have pleased him more than to see them all there.</p>
<p>“Welcome!” he said. “Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!</p>
<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn’t know whether to laugh or not.</p>
<p>“Is he — a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.</p>
<p>“Mad?” said Percy airily. “He’s a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”</p>
<h2 id="5-The-banquet-晚宴"><a href="#5-The-banquet-晚宴" class="headerlink" title="5 The banquet 晚宴"></a>5 The banquet 晚宴</h2><p>Harry’s mouth fell open. The dishes in front of him were now piled with food. He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, for some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.</p>
<p>The Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he’d never been allowed to eat as much as he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if it made him sick. Harry piled his plate with a bit of everything except the peppermints and began to eat. It was all delicious.</p>
<p>“That does look good,” said the ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak.</p>
<p>“Can’t you — ?”</p>
<p>“I haven’t eaten for nearly five hundred years,” said the ghost. “I don’t need to, of course, but one does miss it. I don’t think I’ve in-troduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your service. Resident ghost of Gryffindor Tower.”</p>
<p>“I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me about you — you’re Nearly Headless Nick!”</p>
<p>“I would prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy —” the ghost began stiffly, but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.</p>
<p>“Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”</p>
<p>Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, as if their little chat wasn’t going at all the way he wanted.</p>
<p>“Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder as if it was on a hinge. Someone had obviously tried to behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased at the stunned looks on their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So — new Gryffindors! I hope you’re going to help us win the House Championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got the cup six years in a row! The Bloody Baron’s becoming almost unbearable — he’s the Slytherin ghost.”</p>
<p>Harry looked over at the Slytherin table and saw a horrible ghost sitting there, with blank staring eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He was right next to Malfoy who, Harry was pleased to see, didn’t look too pleased with the seating arrangements.</p>
<p>“How did he get covered in blood?” asked Seamus with great interest.</p>
<p>“I’ve never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.</p>
<p>When everyone had eaten as much as they could, the remains of the food faded from the plates, leaving them sparkling clean as before. A moment later the desserts appeared. Blocks of ice cream in every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate éclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding . . .</p>
<p>As Harry helped himself to a treacle tart, the talk turned to their families.</p>
<p>“I’m half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad’s a Muggle. Mom didn’t tell him she was a witch ’til after they were married. Bit of a nasty shock for him.”</p>
<p>The others laughed.</p>
<p>“What about you, Neville?” said Ron.</p>
<p>“Well, my gran brought me up and she’s a witch,” said Neville, “but the family thought I was all-Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me — he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned — but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner, and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced all the way down the garden and into the road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got in here — they thought I might not be magic enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”</p>
<p>On Harry’s other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking about lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there’s so much to learn, I’m particularly interested in Transfiguration, you know, turning something into something else, of course, it’s supposed to be very difficult —”; “You’ll be starting small, just matches into needles and that sort of thing —”).</p>
<p>Harry, who was starting to feel warm and sleepy, looked up at the High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply from his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, in his absurd turban, was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin.</p>
<p>It happened very suddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked past Quirrell’s turban straight into Harry’s eyes — and a sharp, hot pain shot across the scar on Harry’s forehead.</p>
<p>“Ouch!” Harry clapped a hand to his head.</p>
<p>“What is it?” asked Percy.</p>
<p>“N-nothing.”</p>
<p>The pain had gone as quickly as it had come. Harder to shake off was the feeling Harry had gotten from the teachers look — a feeling that he didn’t like Harry at all.</p>
<p>“Who’s that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.</p>
<p>“Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he’s looking so nervous, that’s Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn’t want to — everyone knows he’s after Quirrell’s job. Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts, Snape.”</p>
<p>Harry watched Snape for a while, but Snape didn’t look at him again.</p>
<p>At last, the desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got to his feet again. The hall fell silent.</p>
<p>“Ahem — just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few start-of-term notices to give you.</p>
<p>“First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well.”</p>
<p>Dumbledore’s twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins.</p>
<p>“I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors.</p>
<p>“Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their House teams should contact Madam Hooch.</p>
<p>“And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death.”</p>
<p>Harry laughed, but he was one of the few who did.</p>
<p>“He’s not serious?” he muttered to Percy.</p>
<p>“Must be,” said Percy, frowning at Dumbledore. “It’s odd, because he usually gives us a reason why we’re not allowed to go somewhere — the forest’s full of dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, at least.”</p>
<p>“And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the other teachers’ smiles had become rather fixed.</p>
<p>Dumbledore gave his wand a little flick, as if he was trying to get a fly off the end, and a long golden ribbon flew out of it, which rose high above the tables and twisted itself, snakelike, into words.</p>
<p>“Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”</p>
<p>And the school bellowed:</p>
<p>“Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts, Teach us something please, Whether we be old and bald Or young with scabby knees, Our heads could do with filling With some interesting stuff, For now they’re bare and full of air, Dead flies and bits of fluff, So teach us things worth knowing, Bring back what we’ve forgot, Just do your best, we’ll do the rest, And learn until our brains all rot.”</p>
<p>Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.</p>
<p>“Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”</p>
<h2 id="6-And-so-to-bed-噩梦"><a href="#6-And-so-to-bed-噩梦" class="headerlink" title="6 And so to bed 噩梦"></a>6 And so to bed 噩梦</h2><p>The Gryffindor first years followed Percy through the chattering crowds, out of the Great Hall, and up the marble staircase. Harry’s legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full of food. He was too sleepy even to be surprised that the people in the portraits along the corridors whispered and pointed as they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had to go when they came to a sudden halt.</p>
<p>A bundle of walking sticks was floating in midair ahead of them, and as Percy took a step toward them they started throwing themselves at him.</p>
<p>“Peeves,” Percy whispered to the first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves — show yourself.”</p>
<p>A loud, rude sound, like the air being let out of a balloon, answered.</p>
<p>“Do you want me to go to the Bloody Baron?”</p>
<p>There was a pop, and a little man with wicked, dark eyes and a wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged in the air, clutching the walking sticks.</p>
<p>“Oooooooh!” he said, with an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”</p>
<p>He swooped suddenly at them. They all ducked.</p>
<p>“Go away, Peeves, or the Baron’ll hear about this, I mean it!” barked Percy.</p>
<p>Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping the walking sticks on Neville’s head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats of armor as he passed.</p>
<p>“You want to watch out for Peeves,” said Percy, as they set off again. “The Bloody Baron’s the only one who can control him, he won’t even listen to us prefects. Here we are.”</p>
<p>At the very end of the corridor hung a portrait of a very fat woman in a pink silk dress.</p>
<p>“Password?” she said.</p>
<p>“Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and the portrait swung forward to reveal a round hole in the wall. They all scrambled through it Neville needed a leg up — and found themselves in the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room full of squashy armchairs.</p>
<p>Percy directed the girls through one door to their dormitory and the boys through another. At the top of a spiral staircase — they were obviously in one of the towers — they found their beds at last: five four-posters hung with deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired to talk much, they pulled on their pajamas and fell into bed.</p>
<p>“Great food, isn’t it?” Ron muttered to Harry through the hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He’s chewing my sheets.”</p>
<p>Harry was going to ask Ron if he’d had any of the treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost at once.</p>
<p>Perhaps Harry had eaten a bit too much, because he had a very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell’s turban, which kept talking to him, telling him he must transfer to Slytherin at once, because it was his destiny. Harry told the turban he didn’t want to be in Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried to pull it off but it tightened painfully — and there was Malfoy, laughing at him as he struggled with it — then Malfoy turned into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold there was a burst of green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.</p>
<p>He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn’t remember the dream at all.</p>

The companies include some of the heavyweights of the industry, like Electronic Arts Productions, Insomniac Games, Activision and Disney.</p>
<p><u>The <code>strike</code> comes in light of an unsuccessful 19 months of negotiations after the existing labor contract known as the Interactive Media Agreement expired in late 2014.</u> Overall, the strike is an effort to provide more secondary compensation along with other concerns, such as transparency upon hiring talent and on-set (制作中) safety precautions.</p>

<h2 id="Diary"><a href="#Diary" class="headerlink" title="Diary"></a>Diary</h2><p>I don’t know why I usually write the diary for the past day. I think it might because I need to think a lot about how to express my thoughts. When I write a diary in Chinese, I just “say” without too much consideration. So when I write diary in English, I spend so much time.</p>
<p>But I’m so lucky that every friend around me spends their time to correct my grammar and talk with me. I have good patience, and I like to talk with others. My friends suggested me <u>becoming</u> a Chinese language teacher the day before yesterday. That might come true, really. I felt a sense of achievement when I taught a friend to say “my name is …, and I’m from Saudi Arabia” in Chinese.</p>

<p>We had a team dinner last night, because our upperclasswoman (I’m not sure about how to express that word, might be “school-sister”?) was graduated successfully.

<p>It has been a long time since I wrote my last diary. There were so many things that happened these days. I went to Beijing last week for my PhD application with my master’s degree advisor. It’s not easy applying for a PhD. So we visited many teachers. Fortunately, many teachers appreciated my abilities. I think I have a good chance to be able to study in Beijing.</p>
<p>One of the most significant impressions I got when I stayed in Beijing was how crowded it was. Beijing is one of the most famous cities around the world. There are so many people living in Beijing. Many young people who work or go to school flock to the subway every morning. They didn’t seem familiar with each other, but the crowd pressed together. I was also one of them, I even felt the temperature from the strangers. I forgot when the last time I hugged someone was, but I’m afraid that I will feel the warmth of people this way in the future.</p>

<p>Hello again, Echo :)</p>
<p>I’m glad to hear your PhD applications went well. I wish you lots of fun in Beijing if you go there!</p>
<p>Did you get accepted already? Then you have “the” chance to study in Beijing. If what you’re trying to say is that you think your application went well, then you have “a chance” instead. I would say “I think I have a (good) chance to be able to study in Beijing.</p>
<p>One little note about the text is the one sentence where you wrote “we”. Don’t suddenly change the pronoun from singular to plural unless the context makes it clear there is another person involved. Throughout the whole thext, the only person I see who is applying in Beijing is you, so I never learnt who else would be included in “we”. Without the context, it makes no sense!</p>
<p>I’m pointing this out because I see a lot of Chinese people make this mistake (probably because pronouns work differently for you, I’m guessing).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Christian!</p>
<p>I’m really happy to receive your correction again :). I got that I shouldn’t suddenly change the pronoun. When I wrote “we visited many teachers” because my master’s degree advisor went to Beijing with me. But I didn’t explain this in my diary, so it made readers confused. I will notice it in my future diary.</p>
<p>And I didn’t get accepted already. I just have a change to take the exam. So I rewrote the sentence to “I have a good chance…”.</p>
<p>Hope you hava a nice day!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I’m happy to help =) </p>
<p>I read the text again and (I think) it’s good now! Your new version is better, now the change in pronoun makes sense!</p>
<p>Good luck with the exam!!</p>

<p>Today, it is really hot. We bought a mobile air conditioner, but the after-sales department told us that we should wait several days until they have the mounting hardware. So we have to bear the hot weather for now. Christian told me that he went to the bouldering hall yesterday. I know that there is a bouldering hall in the shopping mall near our college, but I have never attempted to go climbing there. I don’t know if climbing is popular in China. I know that I seldom hear my friends say they’ll go climbing. I guess maybe climbing is popular in some big cities in China, but the city where I live is so small, people usually work out at the gym. Basketball or table tennis is more likely to be the first choice for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p>
<p>If you want to use “mobile air conditioning”, you have to drop the definite article and just say “We bought mobile air conditioning”. Otherwise, it will make me think you are talking about a specific machine that you mentioned before. However, the reader lacks the context here, and because of that it ends up sounding incorrect.</p>
<p>If you say you “hear [your] friends go climbing”, it means that you are somewhere completely else but they are soooo loud while climbing that you can still hear them…</p>
<p>so that’s why you need to say you rarely hear them say that they’ll go climbing.</p>
<p>If your friends go climbing again, why don’t you give it a shot? :) My friend had suggested it more than once but I was kinda scared to go, too. Eventually, I gave in and I was very surprised by how much I liked it. Maybe it’s not your thing, but you have to try to know! I definitely recommend going with friends, though, it’s much more fun that way.</p>

<p>After several days of rest, I resumed my English studies. I need to stay up late as little as possible. Recent experience tells me that if I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency becomes lower, and my ability to memorize things decreases. The loss outweighs the gain.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the College Entrance Examination, which is vital for most Chinese students. I passed that exam many years before. Even though many years have passed since, I can recall it very well. I was so nervous during the exam. And I really hope the students who will take that exam tomorrow will get a good grade. In China, studying at a good college is really important for the future life. Because a good college means better educational sources, better career opportunities, even wider views.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p>
<p>“If I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency will become lower” isn’t completely incorrect. I do think that as a general statement, the zero conditional works well here to reinforce that. But your version works as well.</p>
<p>I think by “my memory decreases” you meant to say that you get worse and learning things by heart. I corrected your text with that meaning in mind. What you wrote, “my memory decreases”, sounds very strange. But more importantly, without context, I would have thought what you’re trying to say is that you lose memories or the ability to remember things at all (the way people with dementia or Alzehimer’s disease might do).</p>
<p>Also watch out for the wrong prepositions that I corrected :)</p>
<p>Today I went to the bouldering hall and now I’m pretty beat. Is climbing popular in China, too? It’s become a trend in Europe in the last decade or so.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Christian! Thanks for your correction. Here is my note:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Zero Conditional</p>
<p>In zero conditional sentences, the tense in both parts of the sentence is the <strong>simple present</strong>.In zero conditional sentences, we can replace “if” with “when”, because both express general truths. The meaning will be unchanged.</p>
<p>The zero conditional is used to make statements about the real world, and often refers to general truths, such as scientific facts. In these sentences, the time is <strong>now or always</strong> and the situation is <strong>real and possible</strong>.</p>
<p>e.g. If I don’t get enough sleep, my learning efficiency becomes lower.</p>

<p>Hey again, Echo.</p>
<p>Just a little improvement for your notes:</p>
<p>When <code>the ability to memorize things decreases</code>, you can’t MAKE yourself remember something NEW.</p>
<p>When <code>your memory becomes worse</code> (“memory decreases” sounds a bit unnatural), you stop being able to remember things that happened in the past well. It doesn’t have to be from illness, it is said that people’s memory declines (get worse) as they age in general.</p>
<p>Instead of decrease, use the word “decline” in this situation! The common collocations in this context may be a bit hard to figure out unless you’ve read about it previously.</p>

<p>There was heavy rain yesterday. I stayed in the laboratory and met with friends online. And yesterday was also the Children’s Day. A strange phenomenon has appeared these years that even adults celebrate the Children’s Day. Many of my friends received money from their parents and received candies from their friends. Many of my friends usually call themselves a baby. All grownups were once children, and I think they never forget that. And a new policy has been introduced in China.

<p>You start a lot of sentences with “And”, Echo. In colloquial texts like chat messages or in informal speech, this is absolutely fine. But if you want to practice you writing, I think you should try to get rid of this habit. In a formal text, you should use other conjunctions that go at the start of a sentence, because “and” should only really be used to connect two sentences together, not to start one.</p>
<p>I know you realized that with “these days” you should use the simple present, and “these years” really does work in a similar way. However, here I would definitely suggest usage of the present perfect. The appearance of a strange phenomenon is not a general statement about “these years”,  because it is a development. The word “appear” already has this written all over it. Because a phenomenon can only start to appear once, you can’t make this a general statement.</p>
<p>You could say “These years, even adults celebrate Children’s Day”, this sentence works perfectly fine in simple present!</p>
<p>But with “Even adults have started to celebrate”, you’d need to use the present perfect, and your sentence with “appear” has the same problem.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Christian! Thanks for your suggestion. I noticed that I use the word “and” too much. I will use “and” beside two sentences with logical connection.</p>
<p>I learnt that I prefer to use the present perfect because the “appear”  already happened, but “celebrate” have not this question.</p>

<p>These days, I spend almost my whole time studying English. And recently, I felt that I didn’t have enough time, so I stopped my running plan and my guitar training. I did so many IELTS exercises that I dreamed about the exam almost every day. But one thing abruptly came to my mind yesterday, which was that I need to have some balance. </p>
<p>When I was in high school, my parents told me I could enjoy my life when I came to university. When I came to university, my advisor said I could enjoy my life when I found a good job. My friend with a good job told me, his parents asked him to get married to his girlfriend and have a baby, then my friend could enjoy his life. My advisor who has two sons told me that he must work hard to earn money and feed his child. Few people around me have a balanced life indeed. I think many of us are slaves to our lives. Our lives aren’t really  happy, right?</p>
<p>Many professors in our school spend their weekend making meetings for their students and concentrating on scientific research. I think they are excellent teachers. But I would prefer to spend much more time with my family on weekends if I was a professor. Instead of studying all night, I would prefer to play the guitar in the evening, and then have a nice sleep. </p>
<p>We need to improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves. I haven’t seen a full sunset in a really long time.</p>

<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p>
<p>Great text! :) You used a lot of difficult grammar and made few mistakes. I think you have improved since you started posting your texts here!</p>
<p>You can also say “to be a slave to/of life” but the meaning feels different. I think you’re trying to say is that everyone is a slave to their own circumstances, their own lives, so that’s how I corrected it.</p>
<p>“To improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves” isn’t really a sentence, since it lacks a subject. I think it still works here because you are just mentioning it as an idea rather than a statement, but I wanted to make that clear.</p>
<p>I have heard often that in China peer pressure and society’s expectations are very harsh. I don’t really feel fit to comment on this, since I’ve never been to China myself. But I also think that a relaxed attitude towards life is the right way to achieve happiness :) You shouldn’t listen to everyone’s advice, because it will not make you happy - even if it might work for them. I think some people might be very happy to work on weekends for their students’ sake. I personally think taking breaks is more important. But what’s truly important is that you take time to do the things that make you happy and that you learn to appreciate them at the same time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Christian. Thanks for your help! Your careful correction really helps me a lot!</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I searched on dictionary, and I got the differents between “lives” and “life”, and I also got that “be a slave of (something)” is the same as “be a slave to (something)”.</p>
<p>-&gt; Life means the state that follows birth, and precedes death; the state of being alive and living when used as a noun.</p>
<p>-&gt; Lives is the correct plural form of the noun life, which is defined as a living being, especially a person.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, I should say “many of us are slaves to our lives” or “many of us are slaves of our lives”. Is that right?</p>
</li>
<li><p>And I have changed my word to “we need to improve the efficiency of work and enjoy ourselves”. I think it’s more clearly. And thanks for your point.</p>
</li>
<li><p>“When I came to university, my advisor said I could enjoy my life when I found a good job.” In this sentence, it use “found” because of the subjunctive. Is that right? Because I’m a student now, and I will find a job in the future. The same reason as using “was” in folloing sentence, “I would prefer to spend much more time with my family on weekends if I was a professor.”</p>
</li>
<li><p>I also learnt that I should use the present tense when I say “these days”.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hope you have a nice day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey Echo,</p>
<p>1.) Yes, that’s the difference I was talking about :)</p>
<p>2.) Yes, I think that works as well!</p>
<p>3.) Exactly, the “found” comes from the subjunctive. If you look at your original text, you actually did this correctly in the sentence before where you wrote “I could enjoy my life when I came to university”. In this case, the “came” comes from the subjunctive.</p>
<p>In modern English, subjunctive isn’t necessarily used a lot anymore. However, in these sentences you still cannot use another tense. As an alternative way to explain this, you can imagine the sentences as conditional sentences (which is really what they are, even though you substituted the word if with when).</p>
<p>“My advisor said I could enjoy my life if (when) I found a good job.”</p>
<p>“If I found a good job, I could enjoy my life.”</p>
<p>If + simple past, main clause + conditional I (would + infinitive, but would can doesn’t exist and becomes could)</p>
<p>So in this case, I think modern English doesn’t really need the subjunctive to explain the grammar of the sentence anymore. There are other sentences in which the subjunctive is used (or was used commonly in the past, but is usually phrased differently in modern English) where you cannot explain the form of the verb in an alternative way, though.</p>
<p>4.) Yes, absolutely. If you want to use the past tense, you can say “The last few days”/“The last couple of days”/“Recently” + simple past/present perfect instead. Maybe you can tell that these expressions reach from the past to the present but don’t extend past it. “These days” talks about days in the past, but extends what you are saying to days in the future as well. It makes your statement sound more general, and as you know we use the simple present to talk about general statements.</p>
<p>EDIT: I wanted to add that actually, you can use the present perfect with “These days” as well. It’s just the simple past that sounds strange/incorrect.</p>
<p>I wish you a nice day as well! :D</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thanks again! :) I have learned what you teached me except one thing.  Would you mind to tell me the meaning of “EDIT”. It’s my first time to see that. Forgive me that I don’t really understand where you “add”. And “use the present perfect with ‘These days’” is strange or incorrect, I guess?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Editing is when you go back to change something in your text after you finish writing it. I made an edit to my comment after I posted it, so I wrote “EDIT”, then you know this is what I changed, that’s all.</p>
<p>This is also why I “added” this paragraph or this piece of information, because it was not previously in my comment.</p>
<p>And no, using the present perfect with “these days” is not strange or incorrect. Using the simple past is! That’s the thing I was trying to add to my previous correction :)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay! I got it, really thanks!</p>

<p>Today I made two Iranian friends, Mahdi and Rana. They can both speak Farsi and English, and they came to China about one and a half years ago. Since they came to China, they have been learning Chinese. I think their Chinese is really good and I can get the meaning when they talk to me in Chinese. As Rana said, the Chinese language has too many tunes (the Beijing dialect uses four tones). So it’s hard for a Chinese language learner to pronounce things like a Chinese native speaker. But I think languages are just tools, we needn’t remember every word in that language or behave like natives. If we can talk to others and exchange our minds, I think it’s enough. They are both Muslims, like one of my best friends. Rana told me that a Muslim can only marry another Muslim, so he isn’t preparing to find a girlfriend in China. Both of them have really big families, with many brothers and sisters. In China, families have a maximum of two children. They can do many things in our school, like fishing, cooking, having parties, BBQ, etc. But Chinese students don’t have the permission to do so.  And they have just one roomate or even none. I think those things are really deserved by foreign students coming to study in China.</p>

<p>Hi Christian and thanks for your correction. I have corrected my diary, but I have one question. “they have came to China for about one and a half years”, is this sentence right? (I think I should use the present perfect.)</p>

<p>Hey again Echo,</p>
<p>I made a little mistake here myself. The correct version is “They came to China about one and a half years ago”, without “since”. You can also say “They have been in China for about one and a half years” or “They have been staying in China since one and a half years ago”.</p>
<p>Gramatically speaking the sentence “They have come to China for about one and a half years” is correct, but it doesn’t sound right to me. I get what it’s trying to say, but it sounds like they have been on their way to China for 1,5 years and not IN China for 1,5 years. Maybe it’s just me as a German though.</p>
<p>You could make it more clear by saying “They have come to stay in China for about one and a half years”.</p>
<p>I hope you were trying to say that your friends have been in China for 1,5 years now. If what you’re trying to say is they came to China a while ago and are going to stay for 1,5 years in total, you can’t use my first three sentences. In that case you can use the last sentence </p>
<p>“They have come to stay in China for about one and a half years”</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“They came to China and will stay for about one and a half years”</p>
<p>or something like that.</p>
<p>I hope that makes sense to you now? Sorry if it’s confusing.</p>

<p>As I said yesterday, I will discuss the phenomenon of the growing number of learning anchors in modern China.</p>
<p>First of all, the most important reason is more and more students study with their classmates when they come to school. If you ask a Chinese student, who they spent the longest time with, he/she will most likely  say it was his/her classmates. As a result, they develop the habit of needing the company of others. So when students graduate from school or vacation at home, they want to have company, even if it’s from the Internet. One of the other reasons is that families from Chinese urban areas are often having only one child - these young children grow up without any brothers or sisters. So they really lack the care of their peers. Many of them become anchors in order to find people to talk or share their life with online to get more attention. Lastly, I won’t deny that many people become learning anchors just for selling their stationery to earn money.</p>
<p>As for me, I just want someone to stay with me and learn with me. Since I became a learning anchor, I have made a lot of friends. I’m so lucky to know them and their experience really encourages me. I will stick to it, like I usually say, “ we will meet at the top of the knowledge mountain”.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Most of the mistakes here are either superflous words (e. g. increasing) or grammatical oddities (the present form of become sticks out - you are describing something that happened in the past, therefore the past tense). I suggest you revise the past/present/future tenses. I see you tried writing an essay using the usual template (topic sentence, first argument, second argument etc.). I suggest you look into that as well, it could help with any academic writing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Lonely Stargazer,</p>
<p>Thanks for your correction, and I kown my grammar is not good, so I‘m’ reviewing my grammar knowledge these days, especially tenses knowledge. And I’m also preparing for the IELTS exam. So I use that usual template not just for academic writing but also the exam.</p>
<p>I see that Christian Bleischwitz helped you correct your posts. So I guess you must kown him. He is a really nice man. Because he really helped me a lot to my writting. And I think you are also a nice man.</p>

<p>I am an anchor on a Chinese website called Bilibili( live.bilibili.com/11652383 ). My live content is just studying. That sounds so strange, right? Because when we see the word “anchor”, what comes to mind is “live game streaming”. Many Chinese people, especially students want to have company while they are preparing for tests, such as postgraduate tests, IELTS tests, civil service exams, etc. As for me, I get efficient in my studies when I’m under supervision. So I turn on my camera, and share my study process with others online. I think the appearance of many learning anchors is a funny phenomenon, I will discuss it in my diary tomorrow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p>
<p>Good text!</p>
<p>You can also say “what comes to our minds”, but don’t say “our mind” because that suggests everybody was thinking with just one brain…</p>
<p>I think “what comes to mind” without a pronoun is best anyway, because it’s supposed to sound like a general feeling applicable to anyone.</p>
<p>You can also say “I will discuss it in tomorrow’s diary”, but then drop the possesive pronoun (my). If you write “my tomorrow’s diary”, it’ll mean that tomorrow is yours and not the diary, so that doesn’t work. </p>
<p>In my correction above, the tomorrow is just a temporal adverb, technically meaning that the activity of writing take place tomorrow.</p>
<p>In the version “tomorrow’s diary”, it will technically mean that you will discuss it in the diary about the day tomorrow. Practically, it’s the same thing though since diary entries are usually written on the same day as their events.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Christian,</p>
<p>Thanks for your particular correction. I remember that I need to say “what comes to mind”.(I learn that using “our mind” is so funny and not rigorous, I will notice that.) And I also learn that “diary” is written for today, the word imply the time. So we should just say “my diary”, but not “my today’s diary’”. And “my tomorrow’s diary” is not good, the reason is the same as above.</p>

<p>It has been several days since I wrote the last diary entry. In these days, I finished two papers and sent them to the journal. And I also made a plan for the IELTS exam. I slept just several hours these days, and until today, I have my “writing time”.</p>
<p>Today is May, 21. In the Chinese language, “521” or “520” sound similar to “I love you”, so the lovers send flowers or gifts to each other in these two days.</p>

<p>Overall very solid, well done. I would just like to note the following:</p>
<p>1.) “Share” is a transitive verb, hence why I added “with you” - the verb can’t be used without it refering to some object, person or whatever.</p>
<p>2.) You could use either “I’m planning to” or “I plan to” - the latter sounds better IMO. There is a slight semantic difference, if you’re interested (<a href="https://www.italki.com/post/question-187571">https://www.italki.com/post/question-187571</a>).</p>
<p>3.) Has been –&gt; present perfect continuous. Time didn’t stop ticking after you wrote your last entry, so you use present perfect continuous to emphasise that this period continued all the way to the present.</p>
<p>4.) I’m not exactly sure what you meant by accent, I assumed you meant language. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Stargazer,</p>

<p>Lonely Stargazer already gave you great feedback, I just wanted to add that “to share” is actually both a transitive and intransitive verb (for most meanings).<br>One of the examples in Oxford Learner’s Dictionaries for the definition you are using is:<br>“ Men often don’t like to share their problems.”<br>So you can drop the “with you” if you want to, but I agree that it definitely sounds better that way! =)</p>

<p>Yesterday, I had a sad dream. In my dream, things happened during the Republican period of China. There was a pair of lovers who decided to get married. In ancient China, people who wanted to get married needed to get permission from their parents.  So they went back home with their friends, and hoped the boy’s parents could hold the wedding for them. But several days before the wedding, one of the boy’s parents deceived the girl that he would take her to visit her parents. And the girl fell for it. He walked along an alley with the girl and stopped in front of the door of a big old house. He got rid of several black cats for luck, and then he kidnapped the girl with the help of the house owner. They took the girl on a train, and nobody knew where it went. The girl left a letter to the boy, it said: </p>
<p>My dear lover, when you see this letter, you won’t kown where I am. Our love couldn’t get the best of both worlds, but never forget me.</p>
<p>I guess the house owner was a warlord, so he could kidnap the girl and took her away. And the boy’s parents didn’t want their kid get married with the girl, because the parents thought the two young people weren‘t fit for each other. They were so cruel to break them up in that way in order to drop the boy’s idea forever. And I think traditional marriage in China often ended up with a tragedy. The parents usually made the engagement by themselves without considering their kids’ thoughts. The dream was really bad. And I feel so sorry for the two young people in my dream.</p>

<p>Wow, Echo! That’s a really long text. Well done!</p>
<p>The sentence “There was a pair of lovers and they were in love with each other.” is grammatically correct. But of course lovers are in love with each other - that’s why they are lovers. So it sounds super weird.</p>
<p>I would suggest writing “There was a pair of lovers who decided to get married” and skip the next sentence.</p>
<p>There’s a few things I didn’t understand:</p>
<p>What did you mean by “He got rid of several black cats for luck”?</p>
<p>If the girl was kidnapped without knowing it would happen, how could she leave a letter for her boyfriend? LOL I guess sometimes dreams don’t make sense like that.</p>
<p>Also, I don’t understand what you were trying to say by “couldn’t get the best of both worlds’? Which two things are you referring to?</p>
<p>Very few mistakes in general though!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, Christian!</p>
<p>I said “He got rid of several black cats for luck”, because black cats refer to misfortune in ancient culture. About the letter, I guess the girl might found a method to send the letter to the boy when she arrived “unkown-place”, but she couldn’t left their (I wish she could!). About the two things, one is love, the other is the permission of their parents. I want to share a ancient poetry with you, and hope you like it!</p>

<p>These days, I spent a lot of time learning English, but <u>I usually made mistakes because of my carelessness</u>. I found that there are many differences in grammar between English and Chinese. <u>So I needed to change my way of thinking.</u> I used to write “casual” sentences in Chinese daily beacuse I wanted to write down my actual thinking without too much consideration. But I should pay more attention to grammar, especially the way of the native English speakers think. As my teacher said, <u>language isn’t only a tool to talk with other people, but also the representation of a culture (but also part of the the culture which uses it).</u> I wrote down these sentences, and made sure that they could express my thoughts well when others read them. Therefore, I decided to mark <code>every place</code> where I was not sure, and I hope my kind friends could help me correct my grammar errors.</p>

<p>Very good text, Echo! I feel like you put in a little bit more effort and it shows. The grammar you used was more complicated than usual.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what you meant with “thought of the native English speakers”, so perhaps the way I corrected isn’t what you intended to say?</p>
<p>Instead of “the representation of a culture”</p>
<p>you could also say</p>
<p>“a representation of culture”.</p>
<p>If you use “the”, it’s a specific representation and hence cannot be any culture but must be a single one, therefore you need to say “a culture in this case”.</p>
<p>If you only say “a representation” it could be any representation of any culture, so you can drop the article before culture completely.</p>
<p>Either works, but don’t mix them up.</p>
<p><u>About behalf, it’s a word that means you do something as a representative.</u></p>
<p>For example</p>
<p>“I came here on Tom’s behalf”</p>
<p>= I came here because Tom wanted me to represent him.</p>
<p>= I am a representative of Tom.</p>
<p>But you were talking about a representation, not a representative. Representation has multiple definitions:</p>
<p>1) a person or organization that speaks, acts, or is present officially for someone else</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>2) “the way that someone or something is shown or described”</p>
<p>1) is the act of being a representative. But you were using the second definition, which doesn’t have anything to do with that. I hope this clears up some confusion.</p>
<p>Your little comments definitely helped me correct your text. I also think trying to rephrase your own sentences with different words is a good way of practicing your understanding.</p>
<p>Good job!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>My meaning of “thought of the native English speakers” is the same as what you wrote. I will write another dialy to explain it. And I got that “behalf” is used as “representative” (on behalf of sb). Thanks! </p>

<p>Today is the last day of April, so let me make a summary of this month. I restarted to write diary entries now, and my life has recovered to normal after many complex things ended. Thanks to my friends, their company helped me come back. Especially my foreign friends, they really helped me a lot. And I found tenses are really hard to understand. But no matter how difficult it is, I can learn it well!</p>

<p>Hello again, Echo.</p>
<p>I understand your struggle with learning the English tenses. I know Chinese is very different in this regard, so it must be a concept that makes little sense to you! :(</p>
<p>Whenever somebody corrects your mistakes in this regard, you should reflect on the reason why the tense was incorrect. Reviewing the rules of when we use which tense will let you get them right eventually!</p>
<p>In this text, for example, you were using simple present all the time. However, you are sometimes talking about things that already happened, so all of these sentences should be in simple past or present perfect instead.</p>
<p>You could say “I will restart to write diary entries now” as well, this depends on your perspective. Using the simple present here sounds strange, though.</p>
<p>It would be best to say “My life has recovered to normal”, because your life is still normal right now. Simple past would work here as well, though (“My life recovered to normal”).</p>
<p>I put a full stop after “your company helped me come back” because you switched from second person (you) to third person (they). In the first sentence you were adressing your friends directly (“you”) but in the second sentence you talked about them in third person (“they”). You shouldn’t do this in a single sentence.</p>
<p>I hope this helps you a bit!</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Today my friend had a bad stomachache, so I bought a cup of milk tea for her. Also, I rewrote the response to the reviewers of my paper. I felt so tired after finishing it that I didn’ have a conversation with foreigners today. I went to the domitory early and practiced my guitar playing for the whole night. I don’t kown how to express what the weather was like today. It was raining heavily but I could still see the sun. There was loud thunder without any lightning. I dislike this weather. It’s wet, muddy and made me unhappy.</p>

<p>Hello again, Echo.</p>
<p>What kind of reviewers were you talking about? Did someone review your publication, or maybe somebody reviewed your essay for you? The sentence sounds a bit strange without more information.</p>
<p>Instead of “I felt very tired,” you can also say “I felt so tired after finishing it that I didn’ have a conversation with foreigners today”. Just don’t put “so” in both parts of the sentence, one is enough.</p>
<p>You can say “I practiced playing the guitar” or “I practiced my guitar playing”. But you can only practice an activity, and “guitar” is not an activity!</p>
<p>I will read your other texts a bit later. I’m glad you wrote so many things during the holidays!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Bleischwitz,</p>
<p>Thanks for your correcrion, and what I want to say is “I rewrote the response to the reviewers for my paper”. As you kown, I’m a postgratuade student, so I need to write several papers in order graduate successfully. Like writing English diary, I need to spend a lot of time considering how to express my words accurately. And I think writing English diary is much more difficult. LOL</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hey again,</p>
<p>in this case make it “I rewrote the response to the reviewers of my paper” =)<br>If you think that writing an English diary is more difficult than writing the papers for your field of study, then you must at leat be pretty good at that right? :D</p>
<p>By the way, could you explain your name to me? Is Echo Sun related to the translation of your name in Chinese characters?<br>I am asking becuase I keep writing “Hello Echo” and I’m not sure if it’s supposed to be your first or last name (LOL)<br>In Europe we usually talk to each other using first names outside of formal situations. My first name is Christian, so you can write “Hello Christian”!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hello Christian :) </p>
<p>You can call me Echo, and it’s my English name which comes from one of my favorite writers. Her pen name in Chinese is “San Mao”, and her English name is “Echo Chen”. My family name in Chinese is “Sun”, so my English name is “Echo Sun”. The funny thing is that the word “Sun” in English also refer to the sun. I really like to give warm hand to others, just like the sun symbolizes.</p>

<p>A nice lady called Elisen_J said she wants to help me revise the stories what I wrote yesterday. So the diary might be much better in these days. And thanks to Christian Bleischwitz’s help, my writing skill is improving a lot. I feel very luck to become friends with you.</p>
<p>Oreo(奥利奥). When I first bumped into Oreo in 2017, he was hardly a month old and could barely open his eyes. I found him at the corner of a bazaar and saw him all curled up there, shivering. I decided to take him in and shelter him. Fun fact, I mostly fed him goat’s milk since I ever got him. Oreo is an introverted little fella, just like me. If he likes you and enjoys your company, he will just sit or lay right next to you without making a sound. Oh Oreo, my little buddy, I hope you stay healthy and don’t forget to eat well!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a><br>Hi Echo! Your text sounds super natural this time around.</p>
<p>I think “my writing skill is improving” sounds better, because this is a process that takes time. Simple present is not really incorrect, but it definitely sounds unnatural here.</p>
<p>Be careful because it’s writing, not writting with two “t”s :D</p>
<p>I tend to correct all if-clauses if I see their tense is not the way it’s strictly supposed to be. In conversation, “If he likes you, he would just […]” would probably slip right by. But technically, the first part is in simple present, so the second one has to be in will-future (conditional type 1). You could also say “If he liked you, he would” but then it would mean Oreo is unlikely to like other people.</p>
<p>By the way, why did you call him 奥利奥? Do you pronounce these characters like Orio = Oreo?? Or does it have a different meaning?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi, Bleischwitz! Thanks for your help! And the word “奥利奥” in Chinese has the same meaning as “Oreo” in English. Because “Oreo”(the cat) is black and white just like “Oreo”(the cookie). And also, these two words’ pronunciation are the same.  : )</p>
<p>Another question, “If he likes you, he would just […]” doesn’t have problem, right? Because if I change it into “If he liked you, he would just […]” it sounds strange for me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wow, so it really means Oreo! I would never have guessed from the characters. I guess the word was made up to sound like Oreo because 奥 and 利 mean completely unrelated things, I think?</p>
<p>About your question, there is a problem! For this, you should read up on “conditional sentences”. I will try to explain it briefly:</p>
<p>In your case, there are two ways to form this sentence:</p>
<p>“If he likes you, he will […]” (first conditional, you think this is realistic)</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>“If he liked you, he would […]” (second conditional, you think this is unrealistic/unlikely)</p>
<p>With these types of sentences, the tenses in both the if-clause (the part of the sentence that starts with if) and the main clause (the other part of the sentences) are set in stone. You don’t change them and you don’t mix them!</p>
<p>So “If he liked you, he will […]” is not correct.</p>
<p>I know why it sounds strange to say “If he liked”, because it makes you think it’s in the past. But this “if you liked” is not in the past! It means “If he likes you (right now)”, except you don’t think it’s realistic that will happen.</p>
<p>When talking about the past, the sentence would be “If he had liked you”.</p>

<p>I had a tummy stomachache the day before yesterday. So I had a rest yesterday.</p>
<p>In the following days, I’d want to tell some stories about my lovely cats. Hope you will like them.</p>
<p>Jomi(啾咪) was given to a girl as an indulging present by a boy when he was solely a kitten. After the girl turned him down, however, my friend took Jomi in and sheltered him. When Jomi was about two years old, my friend could not keep him further due to his work. Another lady then adopted Jomi. A year had passed, the nice lady became pregnant. She did not feel comfortable keeping the cat during her pregnancy. Fortunately, I was able to take Jomi over and provide him a cozy home. Love you, Jomi!</p>

<p>@<a href="https://en.modole.io/profile/caPZQDE8vSgODEIBGfknAHwGeE93">Christian Bleischwitz</a></p>
<p>In the first sentence, I think you might have wanted to say:</p>
<p>“I had a tummy ache the night before yesterday”?</p>
<p>The way you wrote it, it sounds like you had a tummy ache the day before yesterday’s night. The day before yesterday and the day before yesterday’s night are the same, though.</p>
<p>Also, as I understood it, the lady adopted Jomi and then became pregnant a year later, right? Then you can’t say “obtaining the cat during her pregnancy”, because she already had Jomi before. “To obtain” is the same as “to get”, the action of receiving and not the same as “to have”.</p>

<p>My friend told me that she would send me flowers last night, I was so happy I couldn’t sleep all night! I just want to have an easy life, you know? A simple life without too much trouble, even though that’s hard to achieve.</p>
<p>I helped my friend install a software at noon that can automatically reply to “bullet comments” in bilibili. She thanked me with a cup of fruit milk tea.

<p>Hello again Echo :)</p>
<p>It’s “to help somebody do something”, without another “to”. Watch out for that.</p>
<p>I don’t quite understand what you were trying to say with “We shared what we have”? Are you talking about sharing experiences or sharing possessions? It’s hard to correct for me without knowing, so please let me know. :D</p>
<p>Technically it’s not incorrect to say “The sun broke through the clouds, and the sun shone down on me.”, but it sounds extremely unnatural. With short sentences like this that have the same subject, you shouldn’t repeat it again. </p>
<p>Whether or not you set the comma is up to you. However, when connecting two clauses with the same subject, it is generally advised to set no comma.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>On the 25th, it was very sunny in Germany. I went outside with my friend in the afternoon and we played frisbee together! Afterwards we relaxed in the sun and I ate a lot of blueberries. That really put my mind at ease. I wish you a lot of happy days like that! :D </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m so happy to receive your words.</p>
<p>Let me take an example to explain the meaning of “We shared what we have”. I can make computer programs, and one of my friends can draw very well. So I helped him to solve the problem with computer, and he sent me some nice pictures he draw. That’s what I want to say, we shared the skills what we have, and then, we became good friends.</p>
<p>Your words really help me a lot! Thanks again!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I see what you were trying to say now! You can still use “share” here, but you have to say “to share a skill with somebody”. So in your text, it should say: “We shared our skills with each other, […]”. </p>
<p>If you only say “We shared our skills and became friends”, I think everyone would understand what you mean from the context. However, this sentence doesn’t say anything about who you shared your skills with. So this could also mean you both shared your skills with a bunch of other people because you were both part of the same club, and then you became friends that way. This is why you need the “with each other” for it to sound natural and be clear.</p>
<p>I’m glad my feedback is useful, you’re very welcome!</p>

<p>Yesterday, I watched a TED video called “What Happened When We All Stopped”, the words paired with the song made me feel very inspired. It’s time to once again get closer to mother nature. With more trees and less buildings, we might have a better future.</p>
<p>Last night, I made a new friend called César (/sɪˈzɛ/). This was the first time I have communicated with a foreigner. I was so nervous and not sure what to say so I just listened for a long time. But césar noticed me, and greeted me, and gave me have the chance to talk. He is kind because he tried to slow his speed down in order to let me understand his words’ meaning.</p>

<p>Hey again Echo! I’m very happy to hear you made a new friend from a different place :) I think it’s very important to talk to people from different cultures to broaden your horizons. Overcoming the language barrier can be hard, but it’s worth it. I’m sure if you keep talking to foreigners a lot, you’ll improve at speaking English very quickly!</p>
<p>About your text, you should again be careful not to swap between tenses on accident. If you are talking about events in the past, everything needs to be in simple past. Sometimes you might want to use present perfect or past perfect. But don’t go back to simple present unless:</p>
<p>a) you are no longer talking about the past </p>
<p>or</p>
<p>b) are just stating a general rule.</p>
<p>In your last sentence, “he intended to slow his speed down” sounds like he did not really slow down his speed. This would mean he only tried, but could not do it. So instead it’s better to just say “he tried to slow down” or “slowed down his speech for me”.</p>
<p>I wish you and me both a good day, too! :D</p>

<p>Yesterday, my friend went to the hospital to be vaccinated, and passed by some houses with gardens. There were so many flowers in the garden that I could not name them. When she went back to the terrace, she mumbled with uncontrollable excitement, “Flowers are blooming! Flowers are blooming!”. </p>
<p>Last night, I dreamt that I found a big house with four floors. The landlord said it can hold more than ten people. There was a beautiful garden on the second floor, with a shelf containing a lots of lovely decorations. There was a wall of books on the third floor. On the top floor, there was a terrace where everyone could see the sea. Some bluish violet jellyfishes filled the sea.</p>

<p>Hello again Echo :)</p>
<p>Overall, this was a very good text! You don’t make a lot of mistakes. Your dream sounds very fun. I would tell you about mine, but I already forgot it…</p>
<p>I also have some comments that might help you. They may be a bit hard to understand, but I hope they will be useful anyway. I wish I could explain in Chinese, but sadly I can’t! :(</p>
<p>In the first sentence, you need a place or the sentence will sound incorrect. If you say “She went to do X”, a native speaker will ask themselves “Where did she go?”. The sentence sounds incomplete.</p>
<p>“to have a vaccination” gets the meaning across, but to put this correctly, you need to use the passive. (She was vaccinated = to be vaccinated) </p>
<p>If you do not know how to use the passive yet, you can also say “She got a vaccination yesterday” (It’s informal speech though). </p>
<p>“[…] “Flowers are blooming! Flowers are blooming!”, she mumbled with […]” is how to put the verb after the direct speech. In this case, you need a comma (,) and not a full stop (.) . It’s still the same sentence.</p>
<p>However, you can only say this if you drop the subordinate clause (“When she went back to the terrace,”). With this clause before the rest of the sentence, it sounds very strange if you don’t put the verb before the direct speech.</p>
<p>When using indirect speech, watch out for auxiliary verbs  must, can, may, etc., because they will change.</p>
<p>can -&gt; could</p>
<p>may -&gt; might</p>
<p>must -&gt; have to</p>
<p>So: The landlord said “It can hold up to ten people.”</p>
<p>-&gt; The landlord said it could hold up to ten people.</p>
<p>Both “containing lots of” and “containing a lot of” are okay, but not “a lots” because lots is plural and doesn’t need an article. “a lot of” is already spoken language, but “lots” is even more informal.</p>
<p>Since your dream is over now when you tell the story, you should put everything in it in simple past and not simple present. Watch out not to swap between tenses on accident!</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<h1 id="Harry-Potter-1-5-DIAGON-ALLEY"><a href="#Harry-Potter-1-5-DIAGON-ALLEY" class="headerlink" title="Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY"></a>Harry Potter 1-5 DIAGON ALLEY</h1><p>Harry woke early the next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.</p>
<p>“It was a dream,” he told himself firmly. “I dreamed a giant called Hagrid came to tell me I was going to a school for wizards. When I open my eyes I’ll be at home in my cupboard.”</p>
<p>There was suddenly a loud tapping noise.</p>
<p>And there’s Aunt Petunia knocking on the door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn’t open his eyes. It had been such a good dream.</p>
<p>Tap. Tap. Tap.</p>
<p>“All right,” Harry mumbled, “I’m getting up.”</p>
<p>He sat up and Hagrid’s heavy coat fell off him. The <u>hut</u> was full of sunlight, the storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep on the collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw on the window, a newspaper held in its beak.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>hut /hʌt/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, simple building, usually consisting of one room:<br>a mountain hut<br>a row of beach huts</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry scrambled to his feet, so happy he felt as though a large <u>balloon</u> was <u>swelling</u> inside him. He went straight to the window and jerked it open. The owl swooped in and dropped the newspaper on top of Hagrid, who didn’t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto the floor and began to attack Hagrid’s coat.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>balloon /bəˈluːn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a small, very thin rubber bag that you blow air into or fill with a light gas until it is round in shape, used for decoration at parties or as a children’s toy:<br>We tied balloons and streamers to the ceiling ready for the party.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>swelling /ˈswel.ɪŋ/: <em>noun [ C or U ]</em> a part of your body that has become bigger because of illness or injury:<br>Put your foot into cold water to help the swelling go down.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Don’t do that.”</p>
<p>Harry tried to wave the owl out of the way, but it snapped its beak fiercely at him and carried on savaging the coat.</p>
<p>“Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There’s an owl —” “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted into the sofa.</p>
<p>“What?” “He wants payin’ fer deliverin’ the paper. Look in the pockets.” Hagrid’s coat seemed to be made of nothing but pockets bunches of keys, slug pellets, balls of string, <u>peppermint</u> <u>humbugs</u>, teabags . . . finally, Harry pulled out a handful of strange-looking coins.</p>
<p>“Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>peppermint /ˈpep.ɚ.mɪnt/: <em>noun</em> a strong fresh flavoring from a type of mint plant, used especially to give flavor to candy:<br>She drinks peppermint-flavored tea.</li>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>魔法世界的钱币叫Knuts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Knuts?” “The little bronze ones.”</p>
<p>Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and the owl held out his leg so Harry could put the money into a small <u>leather</u> pouch tied to it. Then he flew off through the open window.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>leather /ˈleð.ɚ/: <em>noun [ U ]</em> animal skin treated in order to preserve it, and used to make shoes, bags, clothes, equipment, etc.:<br>a leather coat/belt/purse</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.</p>
<p>“Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an’ buy all yer stuff fer school.”</p>
<p>Harry was turning over the wizard coins and looking at them. He had just thought of something that made him feel as though the happy balloon inside him had got a puncture.</p>
<p>“Um — Hagrid?” “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots.</p>
<p>“I haven’t got any money — and you heard Uncle Vernon last night . . . he won’t pay for me to go and learn magic.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D’yeh think yer parents didn’t leave yeh anything?”</p>
<p>“But if their house was destroyed —”</p>
<p>“They didn’ keep their gold in the house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards’ bank. Have a sausage, they’re not bad cold — an’ I wouldn’ say no teh a bit o’ yer birthday cake, neither.”</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Wizards have banks?”</p>
<p>“Just the one. Gringotts. Run by <u>goblins</u>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>goblin /ˈɡɑː.blɪn/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> (in stories) a small, ugly creature that is harmful to humans</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry dropped the bit of sausage he was holding.</p>
<p>“Goblins?”</p>
<p>“Yeah — so yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it, I’ll tell yeh that. Never mess with goblins, Harry. Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe — ’cept maybe Hogwarts. As a matter o’ fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin’ you gettin’ things from Gringotts — knows he can trust me, see.</p>
<p>“Got everythin’? Come on, then.”</p>
<p>Harry followed Hagrid out onto the rock. The sky was quite clear now and the sea <u>gleamed</u> in the sunlight. The boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, with a lot of water in the bottom after the storm.</p>
<p>“How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around for another boat.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>gleam /ɡliːm/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to produce or reflect a small, bright light:<br>He polished the table until it gleamed.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Flew,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>“Flew?” “Yeah — but we’ll go back in this. Not s’pposed ter use magic now I’ve got yeh.”</p>
<p>They settled down in the boat, Harry still staring at Hagrid, trying to imagine him flying.</p>
<p>“Seems a shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another of his sideways looks. “If I was ter — er — speed things up a bit, would yeh mind not mentionin’ it at Hogwarts?”</p>
<p>“Of course not,” said Harry, eager to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out the pink umbrella again, tapped it twice on the side of the boat, and they sped off toward land.</p>
<p>“Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Spells — <u>enchantments</u>,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper as he spoke. “They say there’s dragons guardin’ the high-security <u>vaults</u>. And then yeh gotta find yer way — Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London, see. Deep under the Underground. Yeh’d die of hunger tryin’ ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat.”</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>古灵阁在伦敦地下几百英里深的地方，重要的宝库被龙把守。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry sat and thought about this while Hagrid read his newspaper, the Daily Prophet. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon that people liked to be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he’d never had so many questions in his life.</p>
<p>“Ministry o’ Magic messin’ things up as usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning the page.</p>
<p>“There’s a Ministry of Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.</p>
<p>“ ’Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o’ course, but he’d never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning, askin’ fer advice.”</p>
<p>“But what does a Ministry of Magic do?”</p>
<p>“Well, their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there’s still witches an’ wizards up an’ down the country.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone’d be wantin’ magic solutions to their problems. Nah, we’re best left alone.”</p>
<p>At this moment the boat bumped gently into the <u>harbor</u> wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they <u>clambered</u> up the stone steps onto the street.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>harbor /ˈhɑːr.bɚ/: <em>verb (HAVE IN MIND)</em> an area of water next to the coast, often protected from the ocean by a thick wall, where ships and boats can shelter:<br>Our hotel room overlooked a pretty little fishing harbor.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Passersby stared a lot at Hagrid as they walked through the little town to the station. Harry couldn’t <u>blame</u> them. Not only was Hagrid twice as tall as anyone else, he kept pointing at perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>blame /bleɪm/: <em>verb [ T ]</em> to say or think that someone or something did something wrong or is responsible for something bad happening:<br>Don’t blame me (= it is not my fault) if you miss the bus!<br>Hugh blames his mother for his lack of confidence.<br>Hugh blames his lack of confidence on his mother.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Hagrid,” said Harry, panting a bit as he ran to keep up, “did you say there are dragons at Gringotts?”</p>
<p>“Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I’d like a dragon.”</p>
<p>“You’d like one?”</p>
<p>“Wanted one ever since I was a kid — here we go.”</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They had reached the station. There was a train to London in five minutes’ time. Hagrid, who didn’t understand “Muggle money,” as he called it, gave the bills to Harry so he could buy their tickets.</p>
<p>People stared more than ever on the train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like a <u>canary</u>-yellow <u>circus</u> tent.</p>

<p>Harry took the <u>parchment</u> envelope out of his pocket.</p>
<p>“Good,” said Hagrid. “There’s a list there of everything yeh need.”</p>

<p>“Can we buy all this in London?” Harry wondered aloud.</p>
<p>“If yeh know where to go,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>Harry had never been to London before. Although Hagrid seemed to know where he was going, he was obviously not used to getting there in an ordinary way. He got stuck in the ticket barrier on the Underground, and complained loudly that the seats were too small and the trains too slow.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how the Muggles manage without magic,” he said as they climbed a broken-down <u>escalator</u> that led up to a bustling road lined with shops.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Hagrid was so huge that he parted the crowd easily; all Harry had to do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked as if it could sell you a magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full of ordinary people. Could there really be piles of wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and <u>broomsticks</u>? Might this not all be some huge joke that the Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn’t known that the Dursleys had no sense of humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn’t help trusting him.</p>

<p>“This is it,” said Hagrid, coming to a halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It’s a famous place.”</p>
<p>It was a tiny, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn’t pointed it out, Harry wouldn’t have noticed it was there. The people hurrying by didn’t glance at it. Their eyes slid from the big book shop on one side to the record shop on the other as if they couldn’t see the Leaky Cauldron at all. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>海格带着哈利来到 “破釜酒吧”(the Leaky Cauldron) 。只有会魔法的人可以看到它。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a famous place, it was very dark and <u>shabby</u>. A few old women were sitting in a corner, drinking tiny glasses of <u>sherry</u>. One of them was smoking a long pipe. A little man in a top hat was talking to the old <u>bartender</u>, who was quite <u>bald</u> and looked like a toothless <u>walnut</u>. The low <u>buzz</u> of <u>chatter</u> stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed to know Hagrid; they waved and smiled at him, and the bartender reached for a glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Can’t, Tom, I’m on Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand on Harry’s shoulder and making Harry’s knees <u>buckle</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>buckle /ˈbʌk.əl/: verb (FASTEN) to fasten or be fastened with a buckle</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Good Lord,” said the bartender, peering at Harry, “is this can this be — ?”</p>
<p>The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.</p>
<p>“Bless my soul,” whispered the old bartender, “Harry Potter . . . what an honor.”</p>
<p>He hurried out from behind the bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”</p>
<p>Harry didn’t know what to say. Everyone was looking at him. The old woman with the pipe was <u>puffing</u> on it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>puff /pʌf/: <em>verb (BREATHE)</em> to breathe fast and with difficulty, usually because you have been exercising:<br>He came puffing up the stairs.<br>[ + speech ] “I ran all the way home,” she puffed (= said while puffing).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there was a great scraping of chairs and the next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.</p>
<p>“Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can’t believe I’m meeting you at last.”</p>
<p>“So proud, Mr. Potter, I’m just so proud.”</p>
<p>“Always wanted to shake your hand — I’m all of a <u>flutter</u>.”</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can’t tell you, Diggle’s the name, Dedalus Diggle.”</p>
<p>“I’ve seen you before!” said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle’s top hat fell off in his excitement. “You bowed to me once in a shop.”</p>
<p>“He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around at everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!”</p>
<p>Harry shook hands again and again — Doris Crockford kept coming back for more.</p>
<p>A <u>pale</u> young man made his way forward, very nervously. One of his eyes was <u>twitching</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>pale /peɪl/: <em>adjective</em> used to describe a person’s face or skin if it has less color than usual, for example when the person is or sick or frightened, or if it has less color than people generally have:<br>You’re looking pale - are you feeling well?<br>She has a naturally pale complexion and dark hair.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one of your teachers at Hogwarts.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>奇洛教授（Quirrell）出现。黑魔法防御术的老师。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry’s hand, “c-can’t t-tell you how p-pleased I am to meet you.”</p>
<p>“What sort of magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”</p>
<p>“D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, as though he’d rather not think about it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You’ll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I’ve g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on <u>vampires</u>, m-myself.” He looked terrified at the very thought.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But the others wouldn’t let Professor Quirrell keep Harry to himself. It took almost ten minutes to get away from them all. At last, Hagrid managed to make himself heard over the <u>babble</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>babble /ˈbæb.əl/: <em>verb (TALK)</em> to talk or say something in a quick, confused, excited, or silly way:<br>The children babbled excitedly among themselves.<br>She was babbling something about her ring being stolen.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Must get on — lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”</p>
<p>Doris Crockford shook Harry’s hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through the bar and out into a small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but a trash can and a few weeds.</p>
<p>Hagrid <u>grinned</u> at Harry.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>“Is he always that nervous?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin’ outta books but then he took a year off ter get some firsthand experience. . . . They say he met vampires in the Black Forest, and there was a nasty bit o’ trouble with a hag — never been the same since.

</blockquote>
<p>Vampires? Hags? Harry’s head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks in the wall above the trash can.</p>
<p>“Three up . . . two across . . .” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”</p>
<p>He tapped the wall three times with the point of his umbrella.</p>
<p>The brick he had touched quivered — it wriggled — in the middle, a small hole appeared — it grew wider and wider — a second later they were facing an archway large enough even for Hagrid, an archway onto a cobbled street that twisted and turned out of sight.</p>
<p>“Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>海格用伞敲击垃圾箱上的砖块，打开了通向对角巷的路。</p>

<p>He grinned at Harry’s amazement. They stepped through the archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw the archway shrink instantly back into solid wall.</p>

<p>The sun shone brightly on a stack of cauldrons outside the nearest shop. Cauldrons — All Sizes — Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver — Self-Stirring — Collapsible, said a sign hanging over them.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’ll be needin’ one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”</p>
<p>Harry wished he had about eight more eyes. He turned his head in every direction as they walked up the street, trying to look at everything at once: the shops, the things outside them, the people doing their shopping. A plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head as they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, sixteen Sickles an ounce, they’re mad.</p>
<p>A low, soft hooting came from a dark shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium — Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys of about Harry’s age had their noses pressed against a window with <u>broomsticks</u> in it. “Look,” Harry heard one of them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand — fastest ever —” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked with barrels of bat spleens and eels’ eyes, tottering piles of spell books, quills, and rolls of parchment, potion bottles, globes of the moon. . . .</p>

<p>“Gringotts,” said Hagrid.</p>

<p>“Yeah, that’s a goblin,” said Hagrid quietly as they walked up the white stone steps toward him. The goblin was about a head shorter than Harry. He had a <u>swarthy</u>, clever face, a pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed as they walked inside. Now they were facing a second pair of doors, <u>silver</u> this time, with words <u>engraved</u> upon them:</p>

<p>“Like I said, yeh’d be mad ter try an’ rob it,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>A pair of goblins bowed them through the silver doors and they were in a vast <u>marble</u> hall. About a hundred more goblins were sitting on high <u>stools</u> behind a long counter, <u>scribbling</u> in large <u>ledgers</u>, weighing coins in <u>brass</u> scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors to count leading off the hall, and yet more goblins were showing people in and out of these. Hagrid and Harry made for the counter.</p>

<p>“Morning,” said Hagrid to a free goblin. “We’ve come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter’s safe.”</p>
<p>“You have his key, sir?”</p>
<p>“Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto the counter, scattering a handful of <u>moldy</u> dog <u>biscuits</u> over the goblins book of numbers. The goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched the goblin on their right weighing a pile of rubies as big as glowing coals.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>“Got it,” said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny golden key.</p>
<p>The goblin looked at it closely.</p>
<p>“That seems to be in order.”</p>
<p>“An’ I’ve also got a letter here from Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It’s about the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen.”</p>
<p>The goblin read the letter carefully.</p>
<p>“Very well,” he said, handing it back to Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down to both vaults. Griphook!”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Griphook 是另一个妖精,带着哈利和海格去 713 号地下金库取宝物和哈利父母留给哈利的财宝.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all the dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one of the doors leading off the hall.</p>
<p>“What’s the You-Know-What in vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“Can’t tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore’s trusted me. More’n my job’s worth ter tell yeh that.”</p>
<p>Griphook held the door open for them. Harry, who had expected more <u>marble</u>, was surprised. They were in a narrow stone passageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks on the floor. Griphook whistled and a small <u>cart</u> came hurtling up the tracks toward them. They climbed in — Hagrid with some difficulty — and were off.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>At first they just <u>hurtled</u> through a <u>maze</u> of <u>twisting</u> <u>passages</u>. Harry tried to remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. The <u>rattling</u> cart seemed to know its own way, because Griphook wasn’t steering.</p>

<p>Harry’s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end of a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too late — they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge <u>stalactites</u> and <u>stalagmites</u> grew from the <u>ceiling</u> and floor.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“I never know,” Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the cart, “what’s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?”</p>
<p>“Stalagmite’s got an ‘m’ in it,” said Hagrid. “An’ don’ ask me questions just now, I think I’m gonna be sick.”</p>
<p>He did look very green, and when the cart stopped at last beside a small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean against the wall to stop his knees from trembling.</p>
<p>Griphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billowing out, and as it cleared, Harry <u>gasped</u>. Inside were <u>mounds</u> of gold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>gasp /ɡæsp/: <em>verb [ I ]</em> to take a short, quick breath through the mouth, especially because of surprise, pain, or shock:<br>When she saw the money hidden in the box she gasped in surprise.<br>[ + speech ] “Help me!” he gasped.</li>
<li>mound /maʊnd/: <em>noun (PILE)</em> a large pile of earth, stones, etc. like a small hill:<br>a burial mound (= a place where people were buried in ancient times)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“All yours,” smiled Hagrid.</p>
<p>All Harry’s — it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn’t have known about this or they’d have had it from him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them to keep? And all the time there had been a small <u>fortune</u> belonging to him, buried deep under London.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>fortune /ˈfɔːr.tʃuːn/: <em>noun (WEALTH)</em> a large amount of money, goods, property, etc.:<br>She inherited a fortune from her grandmother.<br>He lost a fortune gambling.<br>You can make a fortune out of junk if you call it antiques.<br>This dress cost a (small) fortune.<br>Any painting by Van Gogh is worth a fortune.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Hagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag.</p>
<p>“The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty-nine Knuts to a Sickle, it’s easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o’ terms, we’ll keep the rest safe for yeh.” He turned to Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>金币是Galleons</p>
<p>银币是Sickles</p>
<p>青铜币是Knuts</p>
<p>1 Galleons = 17 Sickles</p>
<p>1 Sickles = 29 Knuts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“One speed only,” said Griphook.</p>
<p>They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. The air became colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by the <u>scruff</u> of his neck.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>scruff /skrʌf/: <em>noun (NECK)</em> by the skin at the back of the neck:<br>Cats carry their kittens by the scruff of the neck.<br>I took/grabbed him by the scruff of his neck and threw him out of the hall.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.</p>
<p>“Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked the door gently with one of his long fingers and it simply melted away.</p>
<p>“If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that, they’d be sucked through the door and trapped in there,” said Griphook.</p>
<p>“How often do you check to see if anyone’s inside?” Harry asked.</p>
<p>“About once every ten years,” said Griphook with a rather nasty grin.</p>
<p>Something really extraordinary had to be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting to see fabulous jewels at the very least — but at first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed a grubby little package wrapped up in brown paper lying on the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed to know what it was, but knew better than to ask.</p>
<p>“Come on, back in this <u>infernal</u> cart, and don’t talk to me on the way back, it’s best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>infernal /ɪnˈfɝː.nəl/: <em>adjective</em> very bad or unpleasant:<br>What an infernal noise!</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>One wild <u>cart</u> ride later they stood blinking in the sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn’t know where to run first now that he had a bag full of money. He didn’t have to know how many Galleons there were to a pound to know that he was holding more money than he’d had in his whole life — more money than even Dudley had ever had.</p>

<p>“Might as well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look a bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin’s shop alone, feeling nervous.</p>
<p>Madam Malkin was a squat, smiling witch dressed all in mauve.</p>
<p>“Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started to speak. “Got the lot here — another young man being fitted up just now, in fact.”</p>

<p>“They were a witch and wizard, if that’s what you mean.”</p>
<p>“I really don’t think they should let the other sort in, do you? They’re just not the same, they’ve never been brought up to know our ways.

<p>“Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped to buy <u>parchment</u> and <u>quills</u>. Harry cheered up a bit when he found a bottle of ink that changed color as you wrote. When they had left the shop, he said, “Hagrid, what’s Quidditch?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he <u>gripped</u> his pink umbrella very <u>tightly</u> as he spoke.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>奥利凡德先生问海格当初被开除学校时折断的魔杖还在不在，海格说还保留着，然后奥利凡德先生问他现在是不是不用那个折断的魔杖了，海格看起来很紧张，回答的时候紧紧握着粉色的伞。</p>

<p>“Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid a <u>piercing</u> look. “Well, now — Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled a long tape measure with silver markings out of his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>piercing /ˈpɪr.sɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> going through or into something: 穿透的<br>Troops have been issued with new armor-piercing anti-tank grenades.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Er — well, I’m right-handed,” said Harry.</p>
<p>“Hold out your arm. That’s it.” He measured Harry from shoulder to finger, then <u>wrist</u> to <u>elbow</u>, shoulder to floor, knee to <u>armpit</u> and round his head. As he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, <u>phoenix</u> <u>tail</u> <u>feathers</u>, and the <u>heartstrings</u> of dragons. No two Ollivander wands are the same, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite the same. And of course, you will never get such good results with another wizard’s wand.”</p>

<p>Harry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was measuring between his <u>nostrils</u>, was doing this on its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around the shelves, taking down boxes.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>nostril /ˈnɑː.strəl/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> either of the two openings in the nose through which air moves when you breathe:<br>The horses came to a halt, steam streaming from their nostrils.</li>

<p>“That will do,” he said, and the tape measure <u>crumpled</u> into a <u>heap</u> on the floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. <u>Beechwood</u> and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. Just take it and give it a wave.”</p>

<ul>
<li>Beechwood n. 山毛榉材</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry took the wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around a bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out of his hand almost at once.</p>
<p>“<u>Maple</u> and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try —”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

<p>Harry tried — but he had hardly raised the wand when it, too, was <u>snatched</u> back by Mr. Ollivander.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. The pile of tried wands was mounting higher and higher on the spindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled from the shelves, the happier he seemed to become.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>这里跟电影版有点不一样，电影中夸张了这里的情节，认为如果是不合适的魔杖挥一下就会搞破坏，但是原文中奥利凡德先生就是让哈利拿一下魔杖就知道这个魔杖合不合适他（最多挥一下），而且让哈利试了很多很多魔杖。</p>

<p>“<u>Tricky</u> customer, eh? Not to worry, we’ll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — <u>holly</u> and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Harry took the wand. He felt a sudden warmth in his fingers. He raised the wand above his head, brought it swishing down through the dusty air and a stream of red and gold <u>sparks</u> shot from the end like a firework, throwing dancing spots of light on to the walls. Hagrid <u>whooped</u> and <u>clapped</u> and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how <u>curious</u> . . . how very curious . . .”</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He put Harry’s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown paper, still muttering, “Curious . . . curious . . .”</p>
<p>“Sorry,” said Harry, “but what’s curious?”</p>
<p>Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry with his pale <u>stare</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“I remember every wand I’ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand, gave another feather — just one other.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Yes, thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. The wand chooses the wizard, remember. . . . I think we must expect great things from you, Mr. Potter. . . . After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things — terrible, yes, but great.”</p>
<p>Harry shivered. He wasn’t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them from his shop.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>哈利的魔杖是十三英寸半场的紫杉木和凤凰尾羽。7加隆买下的。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The late afternoon sun hung low in the sky as Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through the wall, back through the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn’t speak at all as they walked down the road; he didn’t even notice how much people were <u>gawking</u> at them on the Underground, laden as they were with all their funny-shaped packages, with the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Harry’s <u>lap</u>. Up another escalator, out into Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves,” he said.</p>
<p>He bought Harry a hamburger and they sat down on plastic seats to eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.</p>
<p>“You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.</p>
<p>Harry wasn’t sure he could explain. He’d just had the best birthday of his life — and yet — he chewed his hamburger, trying to find the words.</p>
<p>“Everyone thinks I’m special,” he said at last. “All those people in the Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander . . . but I don’t know anything about magic at all. How can they expect great things? I’m famous and I can’t even remember what I’m famous for. I don’t know what happened when Vol-, sorry — I mean, the night my parents died.”</p>
<p>Hagrid <u>leaned</u> across the table. Behind the <u>wild</u> <u>beard</u> and eyebrows he wore a very kind smile.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>“Don’ you worry, Harry. You’ll learn fast enough. Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts, you’ll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it’s hard. Yeh’ve been singled out, an’ that’s always hard. But yeh’ll have a great time at Hogwarts — I did — still do, ’smatter of fact.”</p>
<p>Hagrid helped Harry on to the train that would take him back to the Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.</p>
<p>“Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o’ September — King’s Cross — it’s all on yer ticket. Any problems with the Dursleys, send me a letter with yer owl, she’ll know where to find me. . . . See yeh soon, Harry.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>海格给哈利送上了回德思礼家的火车，并且给了他去霍格沃茨的车票。九月一号，国王十字车站。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The train pulled out of the station. Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until he was out of sight; he <u>rose in his seat</u> and pressed his nose against the window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> rose in his seat 翻译成跪在他的座位上。</p>

True, Dudley was now so scared of Harry he wouldn’t stay in the same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn’t shut Harry in his cupboard, force him to do anything, or shout at him — in fact, they didn’t speak to him at all. Half terrified, half <u>furious</u>, they acted as though any chair with Harry in it were empty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did become a bit depressing after a while.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>furious /ˈfʊr.i.əs/: <em>adjective (ANGRY)</em> extremely angry:<br>I was late and he was furious with me.<br>He’s furious about/at the way he’s been treated.<br>We had a furious debate about the death penalty.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry kept to his room, with his new owl for company. He had decided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay on his bed reading late into the night, Hedwig <u>swooping</u> in and out of the open window as she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn’t come in to <u>vacuum</u> anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead <u>mice</u>. Every night before he went to sleep, Harry <u>ticked off</u> another day on the piece of paper he had pinned to the wall, counting down to September the first.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On the last day of August he thought he’d better speak to his aunt and uncle about getting to King’s Cross station the next day, so he went down to the living room where they were watching a <u>quiz</u> show on television. He cleared his throat to let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran from the room.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>quiz /kwɪz/: <em>noun [ C ]</em> a game or competition in which you answer questions:竞猜<br>a history/sports, etc. quiz<br>There are so many inane television quiz shows.<br>UK A lot of pubs have quiz nights once or twice a week.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Er — I need to be at King’s Cross tomorrow to — to go to Hogwarts.”</p>
<p>Uncle Vernon grunted again.</p>
<p>“Would it be all right if you <u>gave me a lift</u>?” Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>lift /lɪft/: <em>noun [C] (JOURNEY)</em> a free trip in another person’s vehicle, esp. a car:<br>Can I give you a lift home?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>He was about to go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.</p>
<p>“Funny way to get to a wizards’ school, the train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?” Harry didn’t say anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>carpet /ˈkɑːr.pət/: <em>verb (COVER)</em> (a shaped piece of) thick material used for covering floors:地毯<br>We’ve just had a new carpet fitted/laid in our bedroom.<br>UK We’ve got fitted (= cut to fit exactly) carpets in the bedrooms.</li>

</blockquote>
<p>“Where is this school, anyway?” “I don’t know,” said Harry, realizing this for the first time. He pulled the ticket Hagrid had given him out of his pocket.</p>
<p>“I just take the train from platform nine and three-quarters at eleven o’clock,” he read.</p>
<p>His aunt and uncle <u>stared</u>.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>“Platform what?” “Nine and three-quarters.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”</p>
<p>“It’s on my ticket.”</p>
<p>“<u>Barking</u>,” said Uncle Vernon, “<u>howling</u> <u>mad</u>, the lot of them. You’ll see. You just wait. All right, we’ll take you to King’s Cross. We’re going up to London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn’t bother.”</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Why are you going to London?” Harry asked, trying to keep things friendly.</p>
<p>“Taking Dudley to the hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>电影没有交代，一直到哈利去学校，达利的尾巴还在屁股上，因此弗农夫妇准备带他去伦敦做手术，这才顺路带哈利去国王十字车站。</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Harry woke at five o’clock the next morning and was too excited and nervous to go back to sleep. He got up and pulled on his jeans because he didn’t want to walk into the station in his wizard’s <u>robes</u> — he’d change on the train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again to make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely in her cage, and then <u>paced</u> the room, waiting for the Dursleys to get up. Two hours later, Harry’s huge, heavy <u>trunk</u> had been loaded into the Dursleys’ car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley into sitting next to Harry, and they had set off.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>They reached King’s Cross at half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry’s trunk onto a <u>cart</u> and <u>wheeled</u> it into the station for him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing the platforms with a <u>nasty</u> <u>grin</u> on his face.</p>

<p>“Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine — platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere in the middle, but they don’t seem to have built it yet, do they?”</p>
<p>He was quite right, of course. There was a big plastic number nine over one platform and a big plastic number ten over the one next to it, and in the middle, nothing at all.</p>
<p>“Have a good term,” said Uncle Vernon with an even <u>nastier</u> smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw the Dursleys drive away. All three of them were laughing. Harry’s mouth went rather dry. What on earth was he going to do? He was starting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He’d have to ask someone.</p>

<p>He stopped a passing <u>guard</u>, but didn’t <u>dare</u> mention platform nine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts and when Harry couldn’t even tell him what part of the country it was in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harry was being stupid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that left at eleven o’clock, but the guard said there wasn’t one. In the end the guard <u>strode</u> away, <u>muttering</u> about time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not to panic. According to the large clock over the arrivals board, he had ten minutes left to get on the train to Hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it; he was <u>stranded</u> in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift, a pocket full of wizard money, and a large owl.</p>

<p>“How to get onto the platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.</p>
<p>“Not to worry,” she said. “All you have to do is walk straight at the <u>barrier</u> between platforms nine and ten. Don’t stop and don’t be scared you’ll crash into it, that’s very important. Best do it at a bit of a run if you’re nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you’d never heard of Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have a frog? I might get Agrippa — thanks —”</p>
<p>Harry turned over his card and read:</p>

<p>Considered by many the greatest wizard of modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the Dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945, for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon’s blood, and his work on <u>alchemy</u> with his partner, Nicolas Flamel.

<p>Harry stared as Dumbledore sidled back into the picture on his card and gave him a small smile.

</blockquote>
<p>“Is it true?” he said. “They’re saying all down the train that Harry Potter’s in this compartment. So it’s you, is it?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Harry. He was looking at the other boys. Both of them were <u>thickset</u> and looked extremely <u>mean</u>. Standing on either side of the pale boy, they looked like <u>bodyguards</u>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>He held out his hand to shake Harry’s, but Harry didn’t take it.</p>
<p>“I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself, thanks,” he said coolly.</p>

<p>“I’d be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you’re a bit <u>politer</u> you’ll go the same way as your parents. They didn’t know what was good for them, either. You hang around with <u>riffraff</u> like the Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it’ll <u>rub off</u> on you.”</p>

<p>Both Harry and Ron stood up.</p>
<p>“Say that again,” Ron said, his face as red as his hair.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re going to fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.</p>
<p>“Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.</p>
<p>“But we don’t feel like leaving, do we, boys? We’ve eaten all our food and you still seem to have some.”</p>
<p>Goyle reached toward the Chocolate Frogs next to Ron — Ron <u>leapt</u> forward, but before he’d so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let out a horrible yell.</p>

<li>leapt /lept/ : a past tense and past participle of leap</li>

<p>Scabbers the rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth <u>sunk</u> deep into Goyle’s <u>knuckle</u> — Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, <u>howling</u>, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit the window, all three of them disappeared at once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats <u>lurking</u> among the sweets, or perhaps they’d heard footsteps, because a second later, Hermione Granger had come in.</p>

<p>“I think he’s been knocked out,” Ron said to Harry. He looked closer at Scabbers. “No — I don’t believe it — he’s gone back to sleep.”</p>
<p>And so he had.</p>
<p>“You’ve met Malfoy before?”</p>
<p>Harry explained about their meeting in Diagon Alley.</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some of the first to come back to our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they’d been <u>bewitched</u>. My dad doesn’t believe it.

<p>The train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward the door and out on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry <u>shivered</u> in the cold night air.

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>中继台： 由于建筑物/地形等的遮挡，在地面上的2个电台之间的信号可能无法互相传送到。因此，人们在高处建立一个天线并设置一台大功率的特殊的收发电台，负责把一个频点上收来的信号(比如434.460)转发到另外一个频点上(比如439.460)，于是在它覆盖范围内的电台都可以和它联系，也就是通过它和其他人联系，于是大家就通过中继台达到覆盖更广的通连范围，帮助小功率设备扩大信号的目的。</p>
</li>
<li><p>上/下行频率： 通常的中继台需要使用一对频点，一个频点用来接收来自使用者手台或车台的信号(上行信号，如434.460)，当收到时，在另一个频点上广播出去(下行信号，如439.460)。使用中继的人的手台或车台的收发频率要和中继的收发频率相反，才可以打开中继。</p>
</li>
<li><p>差频：一般使用中继设备通讯的时候，都是是用不同的发射和接受频率，接受频率和发射频率之间的频差称之为“差频”，差频又分为上差和下差，一般我们都使用下差，也就是发射频率低于接收频率，</p>

<p>I ask the <u>indulgence</u> of the children who may read this book for <u>dedicating</u> it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason: he is the best friend I have in the world. I have another reason: this grown-up understands everything, even books about children. I have a third reason: he lives in France where he is hungry and cold. He needs cheering up. If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew. All grown-ups were once children– although few of them remember it. And so I correct my dedication:</p>
<p>To Leon Werth</p>
<p>when he was a little boy</p>

<ul>
<li>indulgence /ɪnˈdʌl.dʒəns/: <em>noun</em> an occasion when you allow someone or yourself to have something enjoyable, especially more than is good for you:<br>Chocolate is my only indulgence.<br>All the pleasures and indulgences of the weekend are over, and I must get down to some serious hard work.<br>His health suffered from over-indulgence in (= too much) rich food and drink.</li>

<h3 id="1-1-当个画家"><a href="#1-1-当个画家" class="headerlink" title="1-1 当个画家"></a>1-1 当个画家</h3><p>Once when I was six years old I saw a <u>magnificent</u> picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the <u>primeval</u> forest. It was a picture of a <u>boa constrictor</u> in the act of <u>swallowing</u> an animal. Here is a copy of the drawing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>magnificent /mæɡˈnɪf.ə.sənt/</strong>: <em>adjective</em> very good, beautiful, or deserving to be admired:<br>a magnificent view<br>a magnificent piece of writing<br>They live in a magnificent Tudor house.</li>

<p>In the book it said: “Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without <u>chewing</u> it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for <u>digestion</u>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>chew /tʃuː/</strong> :  <em>verb</em>  [intransitive, transitive] to bite food several times before swallowing it<br>This meat’s so tough I can hardly chew it!<br>chew at/on<br> a dog chewing on a bone</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>di‧ges‧tion /daɪˈdʒestʃən, də-/</strong> :  <em>noun</em>  [uncountable] the process of digesting food </p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I <u>pondered</u> deeply, then, over the <u>adventures</u> of the <u>jungle</u>. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing. My Drawing Number One. It looked like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ponder /ˈpɑːn.dɚ/</strong>: <em>verb [ I or T ]</em> to think carefully about something, especially for a noticeable length of time:<br>She sat back for a minute to ponder her next move in the game.</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285507432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第一号作品"></p>
<p>I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.</p>
<p>But they answered: “Frighten? Why should any one be frightened by a hat?”</p>
<p>My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant. But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly. They always need to have things explained. My Drawing Number Two looked like this:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285607432035.jpg" alt="小王子的第二号作品"></p>
<p>The grown-ups’ response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, <u>arithmetic</u> and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.</p>

<h3 id="1-2-通情达理之人"><a href="#1-2-通情达理之人" class="headerlink" title="1-2 通情达理之人"></a>1-2 通情达理之人</h3><p>I had been <u>disheartened</u> by the <u>failure</u> of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two. Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is <u>tiresome</u> for <u>children</u> to be always and forever explaining things to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>dis‧heart‧ened /dɪsˈhɑːtnd $ -ɑːrtnd/</strong> :  <em>adjective</em> disappointed, so that you lose hope and the determination to continue doing something<br>If young children don’t see quick results they grow disheartened.</p>

<p>So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me. At a <u>glance</u> I can distinguish China from Arizona. If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is <u>valuable</u>.</p>

<p><u>In the course of</u> this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with <u>matters of consequence.</u> I have lived a great deal among grown-ups. I have seen them <u>intimately</u>, close at hand. And that hasn’t much improved my opinion of them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Matters of consequence</strong>, on the contrary, indicate responsibilities, referring to the cause and effect of one’s behavior.

</blockquote>
<p>Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say:    </p>
<p>“That is a hat.”</p>
<p>Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or <u>primeval</u> forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and <u>neckties</u>. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a <u>sensible</u> man.</p>

<p>So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of <u>Sahara</u>, six years ago. Something was broken in my <u>engine</u>. And as I had with me neither a <u>mechanic</u> nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone. It was a question of life or death for me: I had <u>scarcely</u> enough drinking water to last a week.</p>

<p>The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a <u>shipwrecked</u> <u>sailor</u> on a <u>raft</u> in the middle of the ocean. Thus you can <u>imagine</u> my amazement, at sunrise, when I was <u>awakened</u> by an <u>odd</u> little voice. It said:</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“If you please– draw me a sheep!”</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p>“Draw me a sheep!”</p>
<p>I jumped to my feet, completely <u>thunderstruck</u>. I blinked my eyes hard. I looked carefully all around me. And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great <u>seriousness</u>. Here you may see the best <u>portrait</u> that, later, I was able to make of him. But my drawing is certainly very much less <u>charming</u> than its model.</p>
<blockquote>

<li>charming /ˈtʃɑːr.mɪŋ/: <em>adjective</em> pleasant and attractive:<br>We had dinner with our director and his charming wife.<br>What a charming street this is.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter’s career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285707432035.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>

<h3 id="2-2-画一头羊"><a href="#2-2-画一头羊" class="headerlink" title="2-2 画一头羊"></a>2-2 画一头羊</h3><p>Remember, I had crashed in the <u>desert</u> a thousand miles from any <u>inhabited</u> <u>region</u>. </p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet my little man seemed neither to be <u>straying</u> uncertainly among the sands, nor to be <u>fainting</u> from <u>fatigue</u> or hunger or thirst or fear. Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation. When at last I was able to speak, I said to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>stray /streɪ/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  to move away from the place you should be<br>stray into/onto/from<br> Three of the soldiers strayed into enemy territory.</li>
<li><strong>faint /feɪnt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  to suddenly become unconscious for a short time <strong>SYN:</strong> pass out<br>Several fans fainted in the blazing heat.</li>
<li>fatigue /fəˈtiːɡ/: <em>noun (TIREDNESS/WEAKNESS)</em> extreme tiredness:<br>She was suffering from fatigue.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“But– what are you doing here?”</p>
<p>And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence: “If you please– draw me a sheep…”</p>
<p>When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen. But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw. He answered me:</p>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. Draw me a sheep…”</p>
<p>But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often. It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with,</p>
<p>“No, no, no! I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very <u>cumbersome</u>. Where I live, everything is very small. What I need is a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”</p>
<p>So then I made a drawing.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285807432035.jpg" alt="这只羊已经病得很重了。"></p>
<h3 id="2-3-结识小王子"><a href="#2-3-结识小王子" class="headerlink" title="2-3 结识小王子"></a>2-3 结识小王子</h3><p>He looked at it carefully, then he said:</p>
<p>“No. This sheep is already very <u>sickly</u>. Make me another.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>sick‧ly /ˈsɪkli/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em>  a sickly person or animal is weak, unhealthy, and often ill<br>a sickly child<br>She looked pale and sickly.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So I made another drawing.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285907432035.jpg" alt="你画的不是小羊，是头公羊，还有犄角呢。"></p>
<p>My friend smiled gently and <u>indulgenty</u>.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>in‧dul‧gent /ɪnˈdʌldʒənt/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> willing to allow someone, especially a child, to do or have whatever they want, even if this is not good for them<br>toys bought by their indulgent grandparents</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“You see yourself,” he said, “that this is not a sheep. This is a <u>ram</u>. It has <u>horns</u>.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ram /ræm/</strong>:  <em>verb</em>  (rammed, ramming)<br>an adult male sheep → ewe</li>
<li><strong>horn /hɔːn $ hɔːrn/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>ANIMAL<br>a) [countable] the hard pointed thing that grows, usually in pairs, on the heads of animals such as cows and goats → antlers<br>b) [uncountable] the substance that animals’ horns are made of<br> a knife with a horn handle<br>c) [countable] a part of an animal’s head that sticks out like a horn, for example on a snail</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>So then I did my drawing over once more.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/286007432036.jpg" alt="这一只太老了。"></p>
<p>But it was rejected too, just like the others.</p>
<p>“This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.”</p>
<p>By this time my <u>patience</u> was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I <u>tossed</u> off this drawing.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>pa‧tience /ˈpeɪʃəns/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  the ability to continue waiting or doing something for a long time without becoming angry or anxious <strong>OPP:</strong> impatience<br>I wouldn’t have the patience to sit sewing all day.<br> infinite/unlimited/endless patience<br>a good listener who has infinite patience</li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And I threw out an explanation with it.</p>

<p>“This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.”</p>
<p>I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:</p>
<p>“That is exactly the way I wanted it! Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because where I live everything is very small…”</p>
<p>“There will surely be enough grass for him,” I said. “It is a very small sheep that I have given you.”</p>
<p>He <u>bent</u> his head over the drawing:</p>
<p>“Not so small that– Look! He has gone to sleep…”</p>
<p>And that is how I made the <u>acquaintance</u> of the little <u>prince</u>.</p>

<h3 id="3-1-我的飞机"><a href="#3-1-我的飞机" class="headerlink" title="3-1 我的飞机"></a>3-1 我的飞机</h3><p>It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.</p>
<p>The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), he asked me:</p>
<p>“What is that object?”</p>
<p>“That is not an object. It flies. It is an airplane. It is my airplane.”</p>
<p>And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.</p>
<p>He cried out, then:</p>
<p>“What! You dropped down from the sky?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I answered, <u>modestly</u>.</p>

<p>“Oh! That is funny!”</p>

<p>Then he added:</p>
<p>“So you, too, come from the sky! Which is your planet?”</p>
<p>At that moment I caught a <u>gleam</u> of light in the <u>impenetrable</u> mystery of his <u>presence</u>; and I demanded, abruptly:</p>

<p>“Do you come from another planet?”</p>
<p>But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane:</p>
<p>“It is true that on that you can’t have come from very far away…”</p>
<h3 id="3-2-它跑到哪里去"><a href="#3-2-它跑到哪里去" class="headerlink" title="3-2 它跑到哪里去"></a>3-2 它跑到哪里去</h3><p>And he <u>sank</u> into a <u>reverie</u>, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he <u>buried</u> himself in the <u>contemplation</u> of his treasure.</p>

<p>You can <u>imagine</u> how my curiosity was <u>aroused</u> by this half-confidence about the “other planets.” I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.</p>

<p>“My little man, where do you come from? What is this ‘where I live,’ of which you speak? Where do you want to take your sheep?”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/286207432036.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>
<p>After a <u>reflective</u> silence he answered:</p>

<p>“The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.”</p>
<p>“That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.”</p>
<p>But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer:</p>
<p>“Tie him! What a queer idea!”</p>
<p>“But if you don’t tie him,” I said, “he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.”</p>
<p>My friend broke into another peal of laughter:</p>
<p>“But where do you think he would go?”</p>
<p>“Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.”</p>
<p>Then the little prince said, <u>earnestly</u>:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>“That doesn’t matter. Where I live, everything is so small!”</p>
<p>And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added:</p>
<p>“Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far…”</p>

<p>I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was <u>scarcely</u> any larger than a house!</p>
<blockquote>

<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/281607402032.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>
<p>But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets– such as the Earth, <u>Jupiter</u>, <u>Mars</u>, <u>Venus</u>– to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope. When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number. He might call it, for example, “Asteroid 3251.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ju‧pi‧ter /ˈdʒuːpɪtə $ -ər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> the planet that is fifth in order from the Sun and is the largest in the solar system<br> a space probe on its way to Jupiter</li>

<li><strong>Ve‧nus /ˈviːnəs/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> the planet that is second in order from the Sun<br>the high surface temperatures of Venus</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.</p>
<p>This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish <u>astronomer</u>, in 1909.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical <u>Congress</u>, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish <u>costume</u>, and so nobody would believe what he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>con‧gress /ˈkɒŋɡres $ ˈkɑːŋɡrɪs/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable, uncountable] a formal meeting of representatives of different groups, countries etc, to discuss ideas, make decisions etc<br>a congress of the ruling Labor Party</li>

<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/281807402032.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说土耳其天文学家图片"></p>
<p>Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish <u>dictator</u> made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his <u>demonstration</u> all over again, dressed with impressive style and <u>elegance</u>. And this time everybody accepted his report.</p>

They never say to you, “What does his voice sound like? What games does he love best? Does he collect butterflies?” Instead, they demand: “How old is he? How many brothers has he? How much does he weigh? How much money does his father make?” Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.</p>

<p>If you were to say to the grown-ups: “I saw a beautiful house made of <u>rosy</u> <u>brick</u>, with <u>geraniums</u> in the windows and <u>doves</u> on the <u>roof</u>,” they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all.

<p>Just so, you might say to them: “The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.” And what good would it do to tell them that? They would <u>shrug</u> their shoulders, and treat you like a child. But if you said to them: “The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,” then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the <u>fairy-tales</u>. I should have like to say: “Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep…”</p>

If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him. To forget a friend is sad. Not every one has had a friend. And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures…</p>
<p>It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six. I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible. But I am not at all sure of success. One drawing goes along all right, and another has no <u>resemblance</u> to its subject. I make some errors, too, in the little prince’s height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short. And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume. So I <u>fumble</u> along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.</p>

<p>In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault. My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself. But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups. I have had to grow old.</p>

<p>This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly– as if <u>seized</u> by a <u>grave</u> doubt– “It is true, isn’t it, that sheep eat little bushes?</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Yes, that is true.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I am glad!”</p>
<p>I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added:</p>
<p>“Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?”</p>
<p>I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole <u>herd</u> of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>herd /hɜːd $ hɜːrd/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  [countable] a group of animals of one kind that live and feed together → flock<br>herd of<br>a herd of cattle<br>herds of elephants</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.</p>
<p>“We would have to put them one on top of the other,” he said.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282007402033.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>
<p>But he made a wise comment:</p>
<p>“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.”</p>
<p>“That is strictly correct,” I said. “But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?”</p>
<p>He answered me at once, “Oh, come, come!”, as if he were speaking of something that was <u>self-evident.</u> And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any <u>assistance</u>.</p>

Then this little seed will <u>stretch</u> itself and begin– <u>timidly</u> at first– to push a charming little <u>sprig</u> <u>inoffensively</u> upward toward the sun.

<p>Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was <u>infested</u> with them. A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late. It <u>spreads</u> over the entire planet. It <u>bores</u> clear through it with its roots. And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces…</p>

<p>“It is a question of discipline,” the little prince said to me later on. “When you’ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they <u>resemble</u> so closely in their earliest <u>youth</u>.

But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a <u>catastrophe</u>. I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man. He neglected three little bushes…”</p>
<p>So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a <u>moralist</u>. But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my <u>reserve</u>. “Children,” I say <u>plainly</u>, “watch out for the baobabs!”</p>

<p>“I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.”</p>
<p>“But we must wait,” I said.</p>
<p>“Wait? For what?”</p>
<p>“For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.”</p>
<p>At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself. You said to me:</p>
<p>“I am always thinking that I am at home!”</p>
<p>Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France.</p>
<p>If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that. But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps. You can see the day end and the <u>twilight</u> falling whenever you like…</p>

<p>“One day,” you said to me, “I saw the sunset forty-four times!”</p>
<p>And a little later you added:</p>
<p>“You know– one loves the sunset, when one is so sad…”</p>
<p>“Were you so sad, then?” I asked, “on the day of the forty-four sunsets?”</p>

Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent <u>meditation</u> on his problem, he <u>demanded</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Yes, even flowers that have thorns.”</p>
<p>“Then the thorns– what use are they?”</p>
<p>I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to <u>unscrew</u> a <u>bolt</u> that had <u>got stuck in</u> my engine. I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious. And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“The thorns– what use are they?”</p>
<p>The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt. And I answered with the first thing that came into my head:</p>
<p>“The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for <u>spite</u>!”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>spite /spaɪt/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  a feeling of wanting to hurt or upset people, for example because you are jealous or think you have been unfairly treated<br>out of spite (=because of spite)<br>She broke it just out of spite.<br>pure/sheer spite (=spite and nothing else)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>re‧sent‧ful /rɪˈzentfəl/</strong>:  <em>adjective</em> feeling angry and upset about something that you think is unfair <strong>SYN:</strong> bitter<br>resentful of/about/at etc<br>She felt resentful at not being promoted.</li>

<p>“I don’t believe you! Flowers are weak creatures. They are naive. They <u>reassure</u> themselves as best they can. They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons…”</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself: “If this bolt still won’t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.” Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>ham‧mer /ˈhæmə $ -ər/</strong>:  <em>noun</em><br>TOOL<br>a) a tool with a heavy metal part on a long handle, used for hitting nails into wood<br>b) a tool like this with a wooden head used to make something flat, make a noise etc<br>an auctioneer’s hammer</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“And you actually believe that the flowers–”</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” I cried. “No, no no! I don’t believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head. Don’t you see– I am very busy with matters of consequence!”</p>
<h3 id="7-2-蘑菇人"><a href="#7-2-蘑菇人" class="headerlink" title="7-2 蘑菇人"></a>7-2 蘑菇人</h3><p>He stared at me, <u>thunderstruck</u>.</p>

<p>“Matters of consequence!”</p>
<p>He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-<u>grease</u>, <u>bending down</u> over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly…</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>“You talk just like the grown-ups!”</p>
<p>That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, <u>relentlessly</u>:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“You mix everything up together… You confuse everything…”</p>
<p>He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.</p>
<p>“I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower. He has never looked at a star. He has never loved any one. He has never done anything in his life but add up figures. And all day he says over and over, just like you: ‘I am busy with matters of consequence!’ And that makes him swell up with pride. But he is not a man– he is a mushroom!”</p>
<p>“A what?”</p>
<p>“A mushroom!”</p>
<p>The little prince was now white with rage.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/282107402033.jpg" alt="童话小说《小王子》 "></p>
<p>“The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same. And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them? Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important? Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman’s sums? And if I know– I, myself– one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing– Oh! You think that is not important!”</p>

<p>“If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself, ‘Somewhere, my flower is there…’ But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened… And you think that is not important!”</p>
<p>He could not say anything more. His words were <u>choked</u> by <u>sobbing</u>.</p>
<blockquote>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands. Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death? On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted. I took him in my arms, and rocked him. I said to him:</p>
<p>“The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a <u>muzzle</u> for your sheep. I will draw you a <u>railing</u> to put around your flower. I will–”</p>

<p>I did not know what to say to him. I felt <u>awkward</u> and <u>blundering</u>. I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.</p>

On the little prince’s planet the flowers had always been very simple. They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody. One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away. But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet. It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.</p>
<p>The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge <u>bud</u>, felt at once that some sort of <u>miraculous</u> apparition must emerge from it. But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green <u>chamber</u>. She chose her colours with the greatest care. She adjusted her <u>petals</u> one by one. She did not wish to go out into the world all <u>rumpled</u>, like the field <u>poppies</u>. It was only in the full <u>radiance</u> of her beauty that she wished to appear. </p>

<p>For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal.</p>
<p>“And the stars obey you?”</p>
<p>“Certainly they do,” the king said. “They obey instantly. I do not permit <u>insubordination</u>.”</p>
<h3 id="10-3-日落"><a href="#10-3-日落" class="headerlink" title="10-3 日落"></a>10-3 日落</h3><p>Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, with out ever having to move his chair. And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had for <u>saken</u>, he <u>plucked up</u> his courage to ask the king a favor:</p>
<p>“I should like to see a sunset… do me that kindness… Order the sun to set…”</p>
<p>“If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a <u>tragic</u> <u>drama</u>, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?” the king demanded. “The general, or myself?”</p>
<p>“You,” said the little prince firmly.</p>
<p>“Exactly. <code>One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform</code>,” the king went on. “<code>Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.</code>If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution. I have the right to require <u>obedience</u> because my orders are reasonable.”</p>
<p>“Then my sunset?” the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.</p>
<p>“You shall have your sunset. I shall command it. But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable.”</p>
<p>“When will that be?” <u>inquired</u> the little prince.</p>
<p>“Hum! Hum!” replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a <u>bulky</u> <u>almanac</u>. “Hum! Hum! That will be about– about– that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed.”</p>
<p>The little prince yawned. He was <u>regretting</u> his lost sunset. And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.</p>
<p>“I have nothing more to do here,” he said to the king. “So I shall set out on my way again.”</p>

<p>“Minister of what?”</p>
<p>“Minster of– of Justice!”</p>
<p>“But there is nobody here to judge!”</p>
<p>“We do not know that,” the king said to him. “I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old. There is no room here for a <u>carriage</u>. And it tires me to walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but I have looked already!” said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all…</p>
<p>“Then you shall judge yourself,” the king answered. “that is the most difficult thing of all. <code>It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others.</code> If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said the little prince, “but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet.</p>
<p>“Hum! Hum!” said the king. “I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night. You can judge this old rat. From time to time you will <u>condemn</u> him to death. Thus his life will depend on your justice. But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated <u>thriftily</u>.

<p>“Good morning,” said the little prince. “That is a queer hat you are wearing.”</p>

<p>The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.</p>
<p>“This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,” the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other. The conceited man against raised his hat in salute.</p>

<p>“Do you really admire me very much?” he demanded of the little prince.</p>
<p>“What does that mean– ‘admire’?”</p>
<p>“To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.”</p>
<p>“But you are the only man on your planet!”</p>

<p>“Then– the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for <u>repose</u>. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out!”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>re‧pose /rɪˈpəʊz $ -ˈpoʊz/</strong>:  <em>noun</em> formal or literary a state of calm or comfortable rest<br>in repose<br>His face looked less hard in repose.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“That is very funny! A day lasts only one minute, here where you live!”</p>
<p>“It is not funny at all!” said the lamplighter. “While we have been talking together a month has gone by.”</p>
<p>“A month?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a month. Thirty minutes. Thirty days. Good evening.”</p>
<p>And he lighted his lamp again.</p>
<p>As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so <u>faithful</u> to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>“You know,” he said, “I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to…”</p>
<p>“I always want to rest,” said the lamplighter.</p>
<p>For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.</p>
<h3 id="14-3-留恋这颗星"><a href="#14-3-留恋这颗星" class="headerlink" title="14-3 留恋这颗星"></a>14-3 留恋这颗星</h3><p>The little prince went on with his explanation:</p>
<p>“Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly. When you want to rest, you will walk– and the day will last as long as you like.”</p>
<p>“That doesn’t do me much good,” said the lamplighter. “The one thing I love in life is to sleep.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re unlucky,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“I am unlucky,” said the lamplighter. “Good morning.”</p>
<p>And he put out his lamp.</p>
<p>“That man,” said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, “that man would be <u>scorned</u> by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous. Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.”</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>scorn /skɔːn $ skɔːrn/</strong>:  <em>noun</em>  the feeling that someone or something is stupid or does not deserve respect <strong>SYN:</strong> contempt<br>scorn for<br>He felt scorn for his working-class parents.<br>with scorn<br>Rachel looked at me with scorn.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>He breathed a sigh of <u>regret</u>, and said to himself, again:</p>
<blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>“That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small. There is no room on it for two people…”</p>
<p>What the little prince did not <u>dare</u> <u>confess</u> was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was <u>blest</u> every day with 1440 sunsets!</p>

<h2 id="Chapter-15"><a href="#Chapter-15" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 15"></a>Chapter 15</h2><p>- the little prince visits the geographer</p>
<h3 id="15-1-有趣的地理学家"><a href="#15-1-有趣的地理学家" class="headerlink" title="15-1 有趣的地理学家"></a>15-1 有趣的地理学家</h3><p>The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote <u>voluminous</u> books.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283807402038.jpg" alt="地理学家"></p>
<p>“Oh, look! Here is an explorer!” he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.</p>
<p>The little prince sat down on the table and <u>panted</u> a little. He had already traveled so much and so far!</p>
<p>“Where do you come from?” the old gentleman said to him.</p>
<p>“What is that big book?” said the little prince. “What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I am a <u>geographer</u>,” the old gentleman said to him.</p>
<p>“What is a geographer?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.”</p>
<p>“That is very interesting,” said the little prince. “Here at last is a man who has a real profession!” And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.</p>
<p>“Your planet is very beautiful,” he said. “Has it any oceans?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.</p>
<p>“Ah!” The little prince was disappointed. “Has it any mountains?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.</p>
<p>“And towns, and rivers, and deserts?”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t tell you that, either.”</p>
<p>“But you are a geographer!”</p>
<p>“Exactly,” the geographer said. “But I am not an explorer. I haven’t a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go <u>loafing</u> about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. </p>
<h3 id="15-2-你是探察家"><a href="#15-2-你是探察家" class="headerlink" title="15-2 你是探察家"></a>15-2 你是探察家</h3><p>He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“Because <u>intoxicated</u> men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.”</p>
<p>“I know some one,” said the little prince, “who would make a bad explorer.”</p>
<p>“That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.”</p>
<p>“One goes to see it?”</p>
<p>“No. That would be too complicated. But one requires the explorer to <u>furnish</u> proofs. For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.”</p>
<p>The geographer was suddenly <u>stirred</u> to <u>excitement</u>.</p>
<p>“But you– you come from far away! You are an explorer! You shall describe your planet to me!”</p>
<p>And, having opened his big <u>register</u>, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The <u>recitals</u> of explorers are put down first in pencil. One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.</p>
<p>“Well?” said the geographer <u>expectantly</u>.</p>
<p>“Oh, where I live,” said the little prince, “it is not very interesting. It is all so small.“</p>
<h3 id="15-3-什么叫短暂"><a href="#15-3-什么叫短暂" class="headerlink" title="15-3 什么叫短暂"></a>15-3 什么叫短暂</h3><p>” I have three volcanoes. Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct. But one never knows.”</p>
<p>“One never knows,” said the geographer.</p>
<p>“I have also a flower.”</p>
<p>“We do not record flowers,” said the geographer.</p>
<p>“Why is that? The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet!”</p>
<p>“We do not record them,” said the geographer, “because they are <u>ephemeral</u>.”</p>
<p>“What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p>
<p>“Geographies,” said the geographer, “are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned. It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position. It is very rarely that an ocean <u>empties</u> itself of its waters. We write of <u>eternal</u> things.”</p>
<p>“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,” the little prince interrupted. “What does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?”</p>
<p>“Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,” said the geographer. “The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.”</p>
<p>“But what does that mean– ‘ephemeral’?” repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.</p>
<p>“It means, ‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.’”</p>
<p>“Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?”</p>
<p>“Certainly it is.”</p>
<p>“My flower is ephemeral,” the little prince said to himself, “and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone!”</p>
<p>That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.</p>
<p>“What place would you advise me to visit now?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The planet Earth,” replied the geographer. “It has a good reputation.”</p>
<p>And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-16"><a href="#Chapter-16" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 16"></a>Chapter 16</h2><p>- the narrator discusses the Earth’s lamplighters</p>
<h3 id="16-1地球上的国王"><a href="#16-1地球上的国王" class="headerlink" title="16-1地球上的国王"></a>16-1地球上的国王</h3><p>So then the seventh planet was the Earth.</p>
<p>The Earth is not just an ordinary planet! One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the <u>Negro</u> kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men– that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a <u>veritable</u> army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps.</p>
<p>Seen from a slight distance, that would make a <u>splendid</u> <u>spectacle</u>. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera. First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia. Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep. Next, the lamplighters of China and <u>Siberia</u> would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the <u>wings</u>. After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of South America; then those of North America. And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage. It would be magnificent.</p>
<p>Only the man who was <u>in charge of</u> the single lamp at the North Pole, and his <u>colleague</u> who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole– only these two would live free from <u>toil</u> and care: they would be busy twice a year.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-17"><a href="#Chapter-17" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 17"></a>Chapter 17</h2><p>- the little prince makes the acquaintance of the snake</p>
<h3 id="17-1-人类的位置"><a href="#17-1-人类的位置" class="headerlink" title="17-1 人类的位置"></a>17-1 人类的位置</h3><p>When one wishes to play the <u>wit</u>, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters. And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not k now it. Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth. If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide. All humanity could be <u>piled up</u> on a small <u>Pacific</u> <u>islet</u>.</p>
<p>The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They <u>imagine</u> that they fill a great deal of space. They <u>fancy</u> themselves as important as the baobabs. You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations. They adore fig ures, and that will please them. But do not waste your time on this extra task. It is unnecessary. You have, I know, confidence in me.</p>

<p>When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284007402038.jpg" alt="小王子和蛇"></p>
<p>“Good evening,” said the little prince <u>courteously</u>.</p>
<p>“Good evening,” said the snake.</p>
<p>“What planet is this on which I have come down?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“This is the Earth; this is Africa,” the snake answered.</p>
<p>“Ah! Then there are no people on the Earth?”</p>
<p>“This is the desert. There are no people in the desert. The Earth is large,” said the snake.</p>
<h3 id="17-2-奇怪的动物"><a href="#17-2-奇怪的动物" class="headerlink" title="17-2 奇怪的动物"></a>17-2 奇怪的动物</h3><p>The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.</p>
<p>“I wonder,” he said, “whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again… Look at my planet. It is right there above us. But how far away it is!”</p>
<p>“It is beautiful,” the snake said. “What has brought you here?”</p>
<p>“I have been having some trouble with a flower,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Ah!” said the snake.</p>
<p>And they were both silent.</p>
<p>“Where are the men?” the little prince at last took up the conversation again. “It is a little lonely in the desert…”</p>
<p>“It is also lonely among men,” the snake said.</p>
<p>The little prince gazed at him for a long time.</p>
<p>“You are a funny animal,” he said at last. “You are no <u>thicker</u> than a finger…”</p>
<p>“But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,” said the snake.</p>
<p>The little prince smiled.</p>
<p>“You are not very powerful. You haven’t even any feet. You cannot even travel…”</p>
<p>“I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,” said the snake.</p>
<p>He <u>twined</u> himself around the little prince’s <u>ankle</u>, like a golden <u>bracelet</u>.</p>
<p>“Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from <u>whence</u> he came,” the snake spoke again. “But you are <u>innocent</u> and true, and you come from a star…”</p>
<p>The little prince made no reply.</p>
<p>“You move me to <u>pity</u>– you are so weak on this Earth made of <u>granite</u>,” the snake said. “I can help you, some day, if you grow too <u>homesick</u> for your own planet. I can–”</p>
<p>“Oh! I understand you very well,” said the little prince. “But why do you always speak in <u>riddles</u>?”</p>
<p>“I solve them all,” said the snake.</p>
<p>And they were both silent.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-18"><a href="#Chapter-18" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 18"></a>Chapter 18</h2><p>- the little prince goes looking for men and meets a flower</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the flower.</p>
<p>“Where are the men?” the little prince asked, politely.</p>
<p>The flower had once seen a <u>caravan</u> passing.</p>
<p>“Men?” she echoed. “I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago. But one never knows where to find them. The wind blows them away. They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult.”</p>
<p>“Goodbye,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Goodbye,” said the flower.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-19"><a href="#Chapter-19" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 19"></a>Chapter 19</h2><p>- the little prince climbs a mountain range</p>
<h3 id="19-1-雄伟的火山"><a href="#19-1-雄伟的火山" class="headerlink" title="19-1 雄伟的火山"></a>19-1 雄伟的火山</h3><p>After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees. And he used the extinct volcano as a <u>footstool</u>. “From a mountain as high as this one,” he said to himself, “I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people…”</p>
<p>But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like <u>needles</u>.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284407402039.jpg" alt="小王子爬上一座高山。"></p>
<p>“Good morning,” he said courteously.</p>
<p>“Good morning–Good morning–Good morning,” answered the echo.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Who are you–Who are you–Who are you?” answered the echo.</p>
<p>“Be my friends. I am all alone,” he said.</p>
<p>“I am all alone–all alone–all alone,” answered the echo.</p>
<p>“What a queer planet!” he thought. “It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether <u>harsh</u> and <u>forbidding</u>. And the people have no imagination. They repeat whatever one says to them… On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak…”</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-20"><a href="#Chapter-20" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 20"></a>Chapter 20</h2><p>- the little prince discovers a garden of roses</p>
<h3 id="20-1-独一无二的花"><a href="#20-1-独一无二的花" class="headerlink" title="20-1 独一无二的花"></a>20-1 独一无二的花</h3><p>But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the <u>abodes</u> of men.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” he said.</p>
<p>He was standing before a garden, all <u>abloom</u> with roses.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284507402039.jpg" alt="小王子和玫瑰花"></p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the roses.</p>
<p>The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” he demanded, <u>thunderstruck</u>.</p>
<p>“We are roses,” the roses said.</p>
<p>And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe. And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden!</p>
<p>“She would be very much annoyed,” he said to himself, “if she should see that… she would cough most <u>dreadfully</u>, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life– for if I did not do that, to <u>humble</u> myself also, she would really allow herself to die…”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284707402039.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>
<p>Then he went on with his <u>reflections</u>: “I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world; and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees– and one of them perhaps extinct forever… that doesn’t make me a very great prince…”</p>
<p>And he lay down in the grass and cried.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-21"><a href="#Chapter-21" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 21"></a>Chapter 21</h2><p>- the little prince befriends the fox</p>

<p>“Good morning,” said the fox.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283707402038.jpg" alt="小王子和狐狸"></p>
<p>“Good morning,” the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.</p>
<p>“I am right here,” the voice said, “under the apple tree.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” asked the little prince, and added, “You are very pretty to look at.”</p>
<p>“I am a fox,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“Come and play with me,” proposed the little prince. “I am so unhappy.”</p>
<p>“I cannot play with you,” the fox said. “I am not <u>tamed</u>.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Please excuse me,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>But, after some thought, he added:</p>
<p>“What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p>
<p>“You do not live here,” said the fox. “What is it that you are looking for?”</p>
<p>“I am looking for men,” said the little prince. “What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p>
<p>“Men,” said the fox. “They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing. They also raise chickens. These are their only interests. Are you looking for chickens?”</p>
<p>“No,” said the little prince. “I am looking for friends. What does that mean– ‘tame’?”</p>
<p>“It is an act too often neglected,” said the fox. It means to establish ties.”</p>
<p>“‘To establish ties’?”</p>
<p>“Just that,” said the fox. “To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you, on your part, have no need of me. To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me, then we shall need each other. To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world…”</p>
<p>“I am beginning to understand,” said the little prince. “There is a flower… I think that she has tamed me…”</p>
<p>“It is possible,” said the fox. “On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.”</p>
<h3 id="21-2-驯服一只狐狸"><a href="#21-2-驯服一只狐狸" class="headerlink" title="21-2 驯服一只狐狸"></a>21-2 驯服一只狐狸</h3><p>“Oh, but this is not on the Earth!” said the little prince.</p>
<p>The fox seemed <u>perplexed</u>, and very curious.</p>
<p>“On another planet?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are there hunters on this planet?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that is interesting! Are there chickens?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Nothing is perfect,” sighed the fox.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/283907402038.jpg" alt="《小王子》中的猎人"></p>
<p>But he came back to his idea.</p>
<p>“My life is very <u>monotonous</u>,” the fox said. “I hunt chickens; men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike. And, in consequence, I am a little bored. But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life . I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others. Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground. Yours will call me, like music, out of my <u>burrow</u>. And then look: you see the grain-fields down <u>yonder</u>? I do not ea t bread. <u>Wheat</u> is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the colour of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain, which is also golden, will bring me bac k the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat…”</p>
<p>The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.</p>
<p>“Please– tame me!” he said.</p>
<p>“I want to, very much,” the little prince replied. “But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”</p>
<p>“One only understands the things that one tames,” said the fox. “Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops. But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more. If you want a friend, tame me…”</p>
<p>“What must I do, to tame you?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“You must be very patient,” replied the fox. “First you will sit down at a little distance from me– like that– in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing. Words are the source of misunderstandings. But you will sit a little closer to me, every day…”</p>
<h3 id="21-3-特殊的仪式"><a href="#21-3-特殊的仪式" class="headerlink" title="21-3 特殊的仪式"></a>21-3 特殊的仪式</h3><p>The next day the little prince came back.</p>
<p>“It would have been better to come back at the same hour,” said the fox. “If, for example, you come at four o’clock in the afternoon, then at three o’clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances. At four o’clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about. I shall show you how happy I am! But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you… One must observe the <u>proper</u> <u>rites</u>…”</p>
<p>“What is a rite?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“Those also are actions too often neglected,” said the fox. “They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters. Every Thursday they dance with the village girls. So Thursday is a wonderful day for me! I can take a walk as far as the <u>vineyards</u>. But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”</p>
<p>So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure <u>drew</u> near–</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the fox, “I shall cry.”</p>
<p>“It is your own fault,” said the little prince. “I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you…”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“But now you are going to cry!” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is so,” said the fox.</p>
<p>“Then it has done you no good at all!”</p>
<p>“It has done me good,” said the fox, “because of the color of the wheat fields.” And then he added:</p>
<p>“Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”</p>
<p>The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.</p>
<h3 id="21-4-我的玫瑰花"><a href="#21-4-我的玫瑰花" class="headerlink" title="21-4 我的玫瑰花"></a>21-4 我的玫瑰花</h3><p>“You are not at all like my rose,” he said. “As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.”</p>
<p>And the roses were very much embarrassed.</p>
<p>“You are beautiful, but you are empty,” he went on. “One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you– the rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because she is my rose.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284107402039.jpg" alt="小说《小王子》的狐狸"></p>
<p>And he went back to meet the fox.</p>
<p>“Goodbye,” he said.</p>
<p>“Goodbye,” said the fox. “And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.”</p>
<p>“What is essential is invisible to the eye,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
<p>“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important.”</p>
<p>“It is the time I have wasted for my rose–” said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
<p>“Men have forgotten this truth,” said the fox. “But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your rose…”</p>
<p>“I am responsible for my rose,” the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-22"><a href="#Chapter-22" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 22"></a>Chapter 22</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a railway switchman</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the railway switchman.</p>
<p>“What do you do here?” the little prince asked.</p>
<p>“I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,” said the switchman. “I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left.”</p>
<p>And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman’s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.</p>
<p>“They are in a great hurry,” said the little prince. “What are they looking for?”</p>
<p>“Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,” said the switchman.</p>
<p>And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>“Are they coming back already?” demanded the little prince.</p>
<p>“These are not the same ones,” said the switchman. “It is an exchange.”</p>
<p>“Were they not satisfied where they were?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“No one is ever satisfied where he is,” said the switchman.</p>
<p>And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.</p>
<p>“Are they pursuing the first travelers?” demanded the little prince.</p>
<p>“They are pursuing nothing at all,” said the switchman. “They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.”</p>
<p>“Only the children know what they are looking for,” said the little prince. “They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry…”</p>
<p>“They are lucky,” the switchman said.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-23"><a href="#Chapter-23" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 23"></a>Chapter 23</h2><p>- the little prince encounters a merchant</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“Good morning,” said the merchant.</p>
<p>This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.</p>
<p>“Why are you selling those?” asked the little prince.</p>
<p>“Because they save a tremendous amount of time,” said the merchant. “Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.”</p>
<p>“And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?”</p>
<p>“Anything you like…”</p>
<p>“As for me,” said the little prince to himself, “if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.”</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-24"><a href="#Chapter-24" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 24"></a>Chapter 24</h2><p>- the narrator and the little prince, thirsty, hunt for a well in the desert</p>
<p>It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said to the little prince, “these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water!”</p>
<p>“My friend the fox–” the little prince said to me.</p>
<p>“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox!”</p>
<p>“Why not?”</p>
<p>“Because I am about to die of thirst…”</p>
<p>He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me:</p>
<p>“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend…”</p>
<p>“He has no way of guessing the danger,” I said to myself. “He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs…”</p>
<p>But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought:</p>
<p>“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well…”</p>
<p>I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert. But nevertheless we started walking.</p>
<p>When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream. The little prince’s last words came reeling back into my memory:</p>
<p>“Then you are thirsty, too?” I demanded.</p>
<p>But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me:</p>
<p>“Water may also be good for the heart…”</p>
<p>I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.</p>
<p>He was tired. He sat down. I sat down beside him. And, after a little silence, he spoke again:</p>
<p>“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.”</p>
<p>I replied, “Yes, that is so.” And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.</p>
<p>“The desert is beautiful,” the little prince added.</p>
<p>And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams…</p>
<p>“What makes the desert beautiful,” said the little prince, “is that somewhere it hides a well…”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284307402039.jpg" alt="使沙漠更加美丽的，就是在某个角落里，藏着一口井"></p>
<p>I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart…</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said to the little prince. “The house, the stars, the desert– what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible!”</p>
<p>“I am glad,” he said, “that you agree with my fox.”</p>
<p>As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred. It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure. It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth. In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself: “What I see here is nothing but a shell. What is most important is invisible…”</p>
<p>As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: “What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower– the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep…” And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind…</p>
<p>And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-25"><a href="#Chapter-25" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 25"></a>Chapter 25</h2><p>- finding a well, the narrator and the little prince discuss his return to his planet</p>
<p>“Men,” said the little prince, “set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round…”</p>
<p>And he added:</p>
<p>“It is not worth the trouble…”</p>
<p>The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand. This one was like a well in a village. But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming…</p>
<p>“It is strange,” I said to the little prince. “Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope…”</p>
<p>He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284607402039.jpg" alt="《小王子》的水井"></p>
<p>“Do you hear?” said the little prince. “We have wakened the well, and it is singing…”</p>
<p>I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.</p>
<p>“Leave it to me,” I said. “It is too heavy for you.”</p>
<p>I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there– happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.</p>
<p>“I am thirsty for this water,” said the little prince. “Give me some of it to drink…”</p>
<p>And I understood what he had been looking for.</p>
<p>I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.</p>
<p>“The men where you live,” said the little prince, “raise five thousand roses in the same garden– and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”</p>
<p>“They do not find it,” I replied.</p>
<p>“And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is true,” I said.</p>
<p>And the little prince added:</p>
<p>“But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart…”</p>
<p>I had drunk the water. I breathed easily. At sunrise the sand is the color of honey. And that honey color was making me happy, too. What brought me, then, this sense of grief?</p>
<p>“You must keep your promise,” said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.</p>
<p>“What promise?”</p>
<p>“You know– a muzzle for my sheep… I am responsible for this flower…”</p>
<p>I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:</p>
<p>“Your baobabs– they look a little like cabbages.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>I had been so proud of my baobabs!</p>
<p>“Your fox– his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long.”</p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<p>“You are not fair, little prince,” I said. “I don’t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that will be all right,” he said, “children understand.”</p>
<p>So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him my heart was torn.</p>
<p>“You have plans that I do not know about,” I said.</p>
<p>But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead:</p>
<p>“You know– my descent to the earth… Tomorrow will be its anniversary.”</p>
<p>Then, after a silence, he went on:</p>
<p>“I came down very near here.”</p>
<p>And he flushed.</p>
<p>And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me:</p>
<p>“Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you– a week ago– you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region? You were on the your back to the place where you landed?”</p>
<p>The little prince flushed again.</p>
<p>And I added, with some hesitancy:</p>
<p>“Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?”</p>
<p>The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions– but when one flushes does that not mean “Yes”?</p>
<p>“Ah,” I said to him, “I am a little frightened–”</p>
<p>But he interrupted me.</p>
<p>“Now you must work. You must return to your engine. I will be waiting for you here. Come back tomorrow evening…”</p>
<p>But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox. One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed…</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-26"><a href="#Chapter-26" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 26"></a>Chapter 26</h2><p>- the little prince converses with the snake; the little prince consoles the narrator; the little prince returns to his planet</p>
<p>Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little price sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling. And I heard him say:</p>
<p>“Then you don’t remember. This is not the exact spot.”</p>
<p>Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it:</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! It is the right day, but this is not the place.”</p>
<p>I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone. The little prince, however, replied once again:</p>
<p>“–Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand. You have nothing to do but wait for me there. I shall be there tonight.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284807402040.jpg" alt="小王子和蛇"></p>
<p>I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.</p>
<p>After a silence the little prince spoke again:</p>
<p>“You have good poison? You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?”</p>
<p>I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand.</p>
<p>“Now go away,” said the little prince. “I want to get down from the wall.”</p>
<p>I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall– and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end. Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back. But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.</p>
<p>I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow.</p>
<p>“What does this mean?” I demanded. “Why are you talking with snakes?”</p>
<p>I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink. And now I did not dare ask him any more questions. He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck. I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone’s rifle…</p>
<p>“I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine,” he said. “Now you can go back home–”</p>
<p>“How do you know about that?”</p>
<p>I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.</p>
<p>He made no answer to my question, but he added:</p>
<p>“I, too, am going back home today…”</p>
<p>Then, sadly–</p>
<p>“It is much farther… it is much more difficult…”</p>
<p>I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him…</p>
<p>His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.</p>
<p>“I have your sheep. And I have the sheep’s box. And I have the muzzle…”</p>
<p>And he gave me a sad smile.</p>
<p>I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.</p>
<p>“Dear little man,” I said to him, “you are afraid…”</p>
<p>He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.</p>
<p>“I shall be much more afraid this evening…”</p>
<p>Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more. For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.</p>
<p>“Little man,” I said, “I want to hear you laugh again.”</p>
<p>But he said to me:</p>
<p>“Tonight, it will be a year… my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago…”</p>
<p>“Little man,” I said, “tell me that it is only a bad dream– this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star…”</p>
<p>But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead: “The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know…”</p>
<p>“It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night. All the stars are a-bloom with flowers…”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know…”</p>
<p>“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music. You remember– how good it was.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know…”</p>
<p>“And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found. It is better, like that. My star will just be one of the stars, for you. And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens… they will all be your friends. And, besides, I am going to make you a present…”</p>
<p>He laughed again.</p>
<p>“Ah, little prince, dear little prince! I love to hear that laughter!”</p>
<p>“That is my present. Just that. It will be as it was when we drank the water…”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“All men have the stars,” he answered, “but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides. For others they are no more than little lights in the sky. For others, who are scholars, they are problems . For my businessman they were wealth. But all these stars are silent. You– you alone– will have the stars as no one else has them–”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?”</p>
<p>“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing. And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night… you– only you– will have stars that can laugh!”</p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<p>“And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure… and your friends w ill be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!’ And they will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you…”</p>
<p>And he laughed again.</p>
<p>“It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh…”</p>
<p>And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:</p>
<p>“Tonight– you know… do not come,” said the little prince.</p>
<p>“I shall not leave you,” I said.</p>
<p>“I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying. It is like that. Do not come to see that. It is not worth the trouble…”</p>
<p>“I shall not leave you.”</p>
<p>But he was worried.</p>
<p>“I tell you– it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you. Snakes– they are malicious creatures. This one might bite you just for fun…”</p>
<p>“I shall not leave you.”</p>
<p>But a thought came to reassure him:</p>
<p>“It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/284907402040.jpg" alt="《小王子》童话小说图片"></p>
<p>That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound. When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step. He said to me merely:</p>
<p>“Ah! You are there…”</p>
<p>And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.</p>
<p>“It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer. I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true…”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“You understand… it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me. It is too heavy.”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells…”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort:</p>
<p>“You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars. All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley. All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink…”</p>
<p>I said nothing.</p>
<p>“That will be so amusing! You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water…”</p>
<p>And he too said nothing more, because he was crying…</p>
<p>“Here it is. Let me go on by myself.”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285007402040.jpg" alt="他这时坐下来，因为他害怕了。"></p>
<p>And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again:</p>
<p>“You know– my flower… I am responsible for her. And she is so weak! She is so nae! She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world…”</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285107402040.jpg" alt="他轻轻地象一棵树一样倒在地上，大概由于沙地的缘故，连一点响声都没有。"></p>
<p>I too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.</p>
<p>“There now– that is all…”</p>
<p>He still hesitated a little; then he got up. He took one step. I could not move.</p>
<p>There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a tree falls. There was not even any sound, because of the sand.</p>
<h2 id="Chapter-27"><a href="#Chapter-27" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 27"></a>Chapter 27</h2><p>- the narrator’s afterthoughts</p>
<p>And now six years have already gone by…</p>
<p>I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: “I am tired.”</p>
<p>Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say– not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body… and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells…</p>
<p>But there is one extraordinary thing… when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower…</p>
<p>At one time I say to myself: “Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully…” Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.</p>
<p>But at another time I say to myself: “At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night…” And then the little bells are changed to tears…</p>
<p>Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has– yes or no?– eaten a rose…</p>
<p>Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves: is it yes or no? Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes…</p>
<p>And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!</p>
<p><img src="http://www.newxue.com/d/images/xiaowangzi/285207402041.jpg" alt="在我看来，这是世界上最美、也最凄凉的景色。"></p>
<p>This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory. It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on. Wait for a time, exactly under the star. Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is. If this should happen, please comfort me. Send me word that he has come back……</p>
